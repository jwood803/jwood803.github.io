# Intro

This blog will be thoughts and insights about what I've learned throughout the Data Science for Statisticians course at NC State.

Topics of this course will be the following:

- R

- Summarizing data

- Statistical and machine learning

- Sharing analyses

I also have a [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/JonWood) that goes over AI with Microsoft technologies, such as ML.NET and Azure Cognitive Services.
