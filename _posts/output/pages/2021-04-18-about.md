Just a regular developer in North Carolina trying to learn as much as I can and, in turn, to use this site to help share those things with everyone else.

I've tackled on many different technologies and areas of programming. I've started out as a .NET web developer to work my way to using more modern web technologies such as Angular and React. I'm currently pivoting into the world of data science where I'm learning about Python, statistics, machine learning, and data analysis.

I do my best to teach what I know here and on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrDke-1ToEZOAPDfrPGNdQw).
