For this Thanksgiving, I thought sharing a lot of my recent Wintellect blog posts. If I may say, there's a lot of good stuff for you to go through while digesting a Thanksgiving meal. Hope you all enjoy!

## Spectron

I've been doing a bit of [Spectron](electron.atom.io/spectron/) lately for a client and have been posting some insights I've gained from it.

## Xamarin

I've been into Xamarin for quite a while now and have quite a few links that go through different aspects of it, mainly with F#. This includes my very first screencast and using [FAKE](http://fsharp.github.io/FAKE/) with your Xamarin projects.
