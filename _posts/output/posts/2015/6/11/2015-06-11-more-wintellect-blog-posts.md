Like [last time](http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2015/1/22/wintellect-f-blog-post-collection), I mentioned that I've been blogging more at my Wintellect spot, especially when it comes to F#. Below are a couple of more posts since the last time. There's also a cameo post that mixes F# with Xamarin.

- [Access Data Easier with F# Type Providers](http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/jwood/access-data-easier-with-f-type-providers)
- [Using F# for Enterprise Applications](http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/jwood/using-f-for-enterprise-applications)
- [Combining F# and Xamarin Forms to Create Mobile Applications](http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/jwood/combining-f-and-xamarin-forms-to-create-mobile-applications)
