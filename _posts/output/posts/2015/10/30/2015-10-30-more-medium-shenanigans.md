[Once again](http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2013/9/20/even-the-simplest-of-mistakes-happen) I've been playing around (and definitely reading) with [Medium](https://medium.com/). Honestly, this is probably one of the best mediums for writing, especially how much tied it is to Twitter and Facebook for very easy sharing. I figured I'd write a few articles there to share around that community.

- [How Slack Changed Our Company Culture](https://medium.com/@JWood/how-slack-has-changed-our-company-culture-52dc7f238854#.o32aunm1l) - A few items in how moving from email to [Slack](http://www.slack.com) has improved communication at [Wintellect](http://www.wintellect.com).
- [Why Test Developer Productivity On A Single Metric?](https://medium.com/@JWood/why-test-developer-productivity-on-a-single-metric-88fd63426f14#.7sh7gtl8i) - I share a small experience in how a client was measuring my performance by just using reports from the bug tracking software and my thoughts on it.

If interested, y'all can [follow me](https://medium.com/@JWood) on Medium. I do more recommending and writing responses to other articles than creating my own.
