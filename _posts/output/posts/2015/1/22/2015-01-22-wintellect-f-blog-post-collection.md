I know it seems I've been MIA lately, but the truth is I've actually been blogging quite a bit on F# at my spot in [Wintellect](http://www.wintellect.com/) for a little while. Below is a collection of what's currently out there.

- [10 Reasons to Use F#](http://www.wintellect.com/devcenter/paulballard/10-reasons-to-use-f)
- [F# Community Projects](http://www.wintellect.com/blogs/jwood/f-community-projects)
- [Using the F# Interactive](http://www.wintellect.com/blogs/jwood/using-the-f-interactive)
- [My Introduction to Data Science with F#](http://www.wintellect.com/blogs/jwood/my-introduction-to-data-science-with-f)
- [Less Defects with F# Units of Measure](http://www.wintellect.com/blogs/jwood/less-defects-with-f-units-of-measure)

There will definitely be more in the future so keep an eye out there for more posts on F# and there may even be a few on [Xamarin](https://xamarin.com) with F#.
