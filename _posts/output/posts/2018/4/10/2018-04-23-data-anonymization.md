With all the news about the [Cambridge Analytica scandal](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html) that has happened, there's a lot of critical discussions going on about data privacy. With that, I've found a few resources that can help us as data scientists with data anonymation and privacy.

The first one is a video by [Katharina Rasch](https://research.zalando.com/welcome/team/katharina-rasch/) who goes over some tips on how we can anonymize data better.

Another resource comes from Microsoft. They have a [course in data ethics and law](https://www.edx.org/course/ethics-and-law-in-analytics-and-ai). An interesting offering for a program about artificial intelligence, but an important one.
