Just wanted to quickly mention that I'm attempting to start a new podcast. While it won't be very long (mostly less than 15 minutes an episode) and will probably won't come out, at the least, each month, I thought it would be nice to have a show that goes over some of the news at Microsoft that details data and artificial intelligence. So, without further ado, here's [Episode 1](https://jonwood.co/azure-data-and-ai-podcast/2018/4/28/episode-1).
