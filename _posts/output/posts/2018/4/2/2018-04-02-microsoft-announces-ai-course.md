Just this morning Microsoft [announced](https://blogs.microsoft.com/ai/microsoft-professional-program-ai/) a new program in conjunction with EdX that has several courses to teach you all things AI.

There are several intersting courses that make up this program, including the math used and ethics.

I'm excited to start this program soon and am sure I will learn a lot from it.
