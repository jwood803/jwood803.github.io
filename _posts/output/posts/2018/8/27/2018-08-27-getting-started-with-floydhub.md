Deep learning training, especially if you have image data, can take a long time on a machine with only a CPU. But with advances in cloud computing you can move that training to the cloud on a machine that does have a GPU for relatively cheap cost.

In this video I introduce how to use FloydHub, which is one of those cloud services that allows the use of using a GPU.
