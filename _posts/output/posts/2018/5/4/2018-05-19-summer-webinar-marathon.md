This summer I've decided to give not one, but four data related webinars for everyone's learning pleasure.

- [Visualizing Data in Power BI](https://www.wintellect.com/webinar/visualizing-data-power-bi/): A brief introduction to how you can visualize your data within Power BI
- [A Tour of Azure Databricks](https://www.wintellect.com/webinar/tour-azure-databricks/): A basic tour of Azure Databricks, including going over how to create an Azure Databricks instance, the components of Databricks, and demos to show a few cool things about using Databricks for ETL.
- [Building Language Intelligent Apps with Microsoft LUIS](https://www.wintellect.com/webinar/building-language-intelligent-apps-microsoft-luis/): Show what LUIS can do for your apps, how to create a LUIS project, and their components.
- [Be a Bot Builder with the Microsoft Bot Framework](https://www.wintellect.com/webinar/bot-builder-microsoft-bot-framework/): Introduce the Bot Framework, its components, and demo those components in the Bot Emulator.

I hope you will join for at least one of these!
