I still remember back at around 2006 or so while still getting over the breakup of the best television network ever created, [TechTV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechTV), I find out about this fairly new thing call podcasts. This was big back then, especially since the people I loved watching on TechTV came together for their own podcast, [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/) (TWiT). I believe this is still one of the most popular podcasts still around. While I think the TWiT network has some of the best podcast shows out there I have a few others that I get excited to see to have new episodes.

- [Hanselminutes](http://www.hanselminutes.com/) – [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/) is one of _the_ guys to follow if you’re doing any kind of development using the Microsoft technology stack and his podcast is just as good. Usually Scott has a guest on to talk about a certain topic and it’s always informative.
- [Get Up and Code](http://getupandcode.com/) – A fairly recent addition, this is a good one for anyone who wants to get more into fitness and nutrition, and it's not just for developers as the name suggests.
- [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/tag/podcast) – The popular life hacking blog has their own podcast that highlights the popular posts of the week.
- [This American Life](http://www.thisamericanlife.org/) – Probably the biggest podcast currently still going on that has a theme for each show and true stories based on thattheme.

Speaking of the TWiT network, they do have quite a library of shows. Here are my current favorites.

- [This Week in Tech](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech) – The podcast that started it all. This is still the popular one of tech podcasts and definitely a fan favorite of many TechTV fans.
- [Tech News Today](http://twit.tv/show/tech-news-today) – What better way to get tech news than a daily podcast?
- [The Tech Guy](http://twit.tv/show/the-tech-guy) – [Leo Laporte’s](http://leoville.com/bio) weekend radio show where he helps callers with their tech questions.
- [This Week in Law](http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-law) – I've always had an interest in law and this show plugs that gap in for me in an easily digestible format.
- [Triangulation](http://twit.tv/show/triangulation) – An interview type show that lets you get to know people in tech.
- [Windows Weekly](http://twit.tv/show/windows-weekly) – A weekly show about all things Microsoft!

That’s quite a lot of shows. They usually come out once a week so that’s basically a week’s worth of entertainment right there. I’m sure there’s tons of other awesome shows out there that I have yet to discover and I can’t wait until I do get to discover them.
