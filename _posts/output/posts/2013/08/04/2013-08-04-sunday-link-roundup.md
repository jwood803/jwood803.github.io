What's a Sunday without some links? Here's a couple of stuff I found interesting this past week.

- [Being a Better Programmer course](http://blog.pluralsight.com/2013/07/31/new-course-learning-to-program-being-a-better-programmer/) ([Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com/) and [Iris Classon](http://www.irisclasson.com/), [PluralSight](http://pluralsight.com/training/)) - A recent course on different ways you can learn to be a better developer. Includes tons of links, books, and different techniques to manage your time for self-education.
- [When Lousy Code Strikes, Google Dispatches Its Elite ‘Gopher Team’](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/07/gopher/) (Klint Finley, [Wired](http://www.wired.com/)) - Interesting article that gives a bit of history on Google's Go language and some insight to one of the teams they have there.
- [7 JavaScript Basics Many Developers Aren't Using (Properly)](http://tech.pro/tutorial/1453/7-javascript-basics-many-developers-aren-t-using-properly) (David Walsh, [TechPro](http://tech.pro/)) - A few JavaScript tips that seem like they can be useful. I'm nowhere near decent at JavaScript yet, but I found these tips interesting and I definitely learned some stuff.
- [Knockout.js Cheat sheet for Beginners](http://www.devcurry.com/2013/07/knockoutjs-cheat-sheet-for-beginners.html#.UfugXI3ryWo) (Sumit Maitra, [DevCurry](http://www.devcurry.com/)) - I'm still relatively new to Knockout.js myself and this is a concise list of what you need to know for it to help you get started. Wish I had this when I first started with Knockout.js.
- [A rich new JavaScript code editor spreading to several Microsoft web sites](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ARichNewJavaScriptCodeEditorSpreadingToSeveralMicrosoftWebSites.aspx) ([Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/)) - Microsoft is apparently sneaking in some cool features. It seems that you are able to edit code within several sites from them, including SkyDrive. How awesome is that?!
