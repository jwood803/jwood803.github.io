After noticing that more and more blogs and other web content are moving toward using [Disqus](http://disqus.com/) as their medium for comments, I thought it would be best to move mine over to the platform as well.

The main advantage I wanted to gain for the readers here is that there is one less thing for them to have to register and/or worry about following. With Disqus, you have all your comments and actionable items in one place and users have the ability to even use it via a login from other social media sites. It's a total win-win situation!
