title: "Top People I Follow on Twitter"

I love Twitter. I like how it's one of the best ways to share content and thoughts with everyone else. However, following too many people can put too much of a strain on you when checking for updates. I, like I'm sure many others do, have a few people I make sure to read each update I come across. Here's a list of those few I do my best to keep up with.

Note that when I say "people" on Twitter I also mean organizations as well as individuals.

### Alexis Ohanian

Alexis is probably most famous as being cofounder of reddit, but he's definitely doing some amazing work these days. From writing his own [book](http://withouttheirpermission.com/) (you bet I got this the day it came out) to hosting an entrepreneurial show on The Verge - [Small Empires](http://www.theverge.com/video/small-empires), he's definitely one to follow and I'm always excited to see what he's up to next.

### Inc Magazine

If you're interested in business or leadership at all, this magazine and site has a lot of great articles that I've found useful. Their site practicing minimalism and very easy to navigate also helps.

### Kevin Rose

If you're into technology at all, then this name should at least be familiar to you. Coming from the old (and awesome) days of TechTV via the show The Screen Savers, he's also the founder of [Digg](http://digg.com/) and now currently works with [Google Ventures](http://www.googleventures.com/) helping to find other awesome web start ups.

### Darya Rose

Yep, the wife of Kevin Rose. She's fairly well known herself for starting a food blog - [Summer Tomato](http://summertomato.com/) (whom I happen to have found from the person below) and from there her own book - [Foodist](http://www.amazon.com/Foodist-Science-Weight-Without-Dieting/dp/0062201255). Darya is definitely one of the best I've come across in terms of breaking down the science of healthy food into a way that is easily understandable. If anyone I meet has questions on food I always point them to her.

### Tim Ferriss

Famous for his books - [Four Hour Workweek](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357), [Four Hour Body](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Body-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X), and [Four Hour Chef](http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Chef-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591), I definitely consider Tim to be a modern day Renaissance Man. From starting his own nutritional company to becoming a tango and kickboxing champion, Tim has tons of experiences and he freely gives his advice away on his [blog](http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/).

### John Robbins

This can't be a post on a development blog without a developer, could it? I consider John, cofounder of [Wintellect](http://www.wintellect.com/), to be one of the best when it comes to doing anything with .NET. This is the guy who got me interested in performance and debugging. When Microsoft has them come in to teach their developers, I make sure to listen on what they have to say.
