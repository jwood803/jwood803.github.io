This is a bit different than most posts here, but I've come to just love what [Medium](https://medium.com/) does. If you haven't heard of it, it's basically a medium (pun intended, of course) in which anybody can come in and write articles about whatever they're passionate about or what inspires them. I've definitely found many great reads there. Since it seems like a great place to just get feedback I thought I'd give it a shot myself.

I've recently had a bit of an...embarrassing event happen in my career and I thought it would be a good story to share through Medium. So I hope you take a few minutes (seriously, Medium indicated that it's a two minute read) and maybe have a laugh at my expense and see that [even the most professional of people can make trivial mistakes](https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/e2cc4ea78204).
