I've often thought about being the one in front of the room during a [code camp](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Camp) or some other speaking event. Though, like most of us, I've always been reluctant to put myself up there, scared that someone will call me out on not knowing what I was talking about or, worse yet, they all walk out on me.

However, with the fine coworkers at [Wintellect](http://www.wintellect.com/) and other friends, I decided to bite the bullet and sign up as a speaker for the [Carolina Code Camp](http://codecamp.developersguild.org/) this year. After a couple of days of debating with myself on what to talk about, I decided that a talk on the JavaScript garbage collector would be interesting. I've always enjoyed learning about performance and this should be practical for others to learn as well.

So if you're near the Charlotte, NC area on Saturday, May 3, I encourage you to attend what has always been a great event since I've been going three years ago. Hope to see you there! If you end up going and even go to my session, try to refrain from throwing things.
