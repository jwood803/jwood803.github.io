Last time I [mentioned](http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2014/3/23/my-first-speaking-engagement-is-official) that I would be giving a talk at a local event - the [Carolina Code Camp.](http://codecamp.developersguild.org/) Well, today was that day and I'm happy to report that the presentation and the event as a whole went very well! I hope to refine the presentation even further to present again at future events.

For anyone interested the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/jwood803/JavaScriptGCDemystified) that holds the actual presentation with all links used is available to view.

For a working version of the presentation (latest version), it can be found [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jwood803/JavaScriptGCDemystified/blob/master/index.html).
