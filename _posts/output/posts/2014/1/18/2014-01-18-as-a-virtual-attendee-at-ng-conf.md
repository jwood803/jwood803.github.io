This past Thursday and Friday, Google held a public conference for all things AngularJS. I'm sure you've noticed lately that I've been a bit of a fan of it, especially the more I play around with what it all has to offer. 

Luckily, the fine folks who put on the conference decided to stream it as it was going on. Awesome! I got to catch a few of the sessions. Though, it's not the same as actually attending as I couldn't meet all the great people and speakers there, watching the live stream is the next best thing.

I didn't get to see all of the sessions yet (they have all been [uploaded](https://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos)), but here are the ones I have seen that seemed to stand out:

- Before any of the sessions, the two keynotes are a must watch first
    - [Miško Hevery and Brad Green](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1A1VR0ibIQ)  - The past and future of AngularJS
    - [Igor Minar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-SQvre_6qU) - The AngularJS community
- [AngularJS in 20ish Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXO-i7944M) - Dan Wahlin's [AngularJS in 60ish Minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM) video is what got me started in AngularJS.
- [Filters Beyond OrderBy and LimitTo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4FJ_kuO9Rc) - Interesting look at AngularJS filters. The performance of this looks amazing!
- [Zones](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqtmUscE_U) - Doesn't seem like much to run all async code in a "zone", but this definitely has some good uses.
- [Using AngularJS to Create Mobile Applications with PhoneGap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVntVkRLR3M) - Even web developers can create mobile applications!

In total, I'm glad I was able to catch what I could of the live stream and hope that next time I can be able to join in person. I hope at some point I can be able to [contribute](http://angularjs.org/i-want-to-help) something to help make everyone's life easier with AngularJS.
