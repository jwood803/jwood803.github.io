      <title>Consuming the Jamendo API with AngularJS: HTTP Get</title>
      <link>/blog/175</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p></p><p>After doing a <a href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2013/8/22/intro-to-angularjs" target="_blank">small AngularJS introduction</a>, I figured it's time to start diving into some specifics of an Single Page Application with it.</p><p>One of the awesome things developers can do is to play with other third party services. A common way to do that is with an API that is provided by the creators of the service to give developers the option to create all sorts of software to use or interact with their services.</p><p>Honestly, I had a class library created and ready to create a C# wrapper to make the API calls, but I thought that I should use more client side code instead of server side code as that tends to be more of how things are being done these days. I thought I'd use AngularJS, which I chose so I can learn more on how to use the framework and well as to get used to developing more with JavaScript.</p><h2><span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6em;"></span></h2><p></p>
</div>






















<p class="note"><strong>NOTE:</strong> For the API calls to Jamendo I'm using a <em>clientId</em> that they provide for testing and demoing only. This is required to use the API and if you want to take full advantage of their API you will need to register in their <a href="https://devportal.jamendo.com/">Development Center</a>.</p>

<p>For this first part I'll construct a simple artist search via <em>$http</em> from Angular's <a href="http://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng.$http">API</a> to return a few items back from the Jamendo API for display.</p>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em; background-color: transparent;"></span></p><p></p><h2>The HTML</h2><p>The HTML is a fairly similar setup as the previously mentioned <a href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2013/8/22/intro-to-angularjs" target="_blank">introduction</a>.&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">And please remember, I'm by all means no designer (though, I have been reading up on the subject) so I apologize in advance if it causes you to cringe.&nbsp;</span></p><p></p><p>What we'll concentrate on is what all is in the body tag as the items in the head tag are just pulling in different resources. We tell the <em>body </em>tag to use our Album controller (we'll get further into that below). I then created a <em>div </em>tag that uses a class from one of our CSS files to move everything in there to the near center of our page.&nbsp;</p><p>Now to the fun stuff. Inside our container we have a text input and a button. Our text box will be what artist we're searching for on Jamendo and our button will be used to conduct the call to get our results. <br></p><p>On our text box we have the <em>ng-model</em> directive named "artist". We'll see how this gets used later in our controller.</p><p></p><p>Our button has the <em>ng-click</em> directive which tells Angular to execute this method on our controller once the button is clicked.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6956281.js?file=JamendoAngularHtml.html"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p></p><h2>The Album Controller</h2><p></p><p>Once again, this is fairly similar to our <a href="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6405598" target="_blank">Employees controller</a> from our introduction. The differences are fairly small, however. One thing you may notice is when defining the controller function I bring in an extra parameter that AngularJS provides. Along with the $scope I bring in $http to be able to call another site. In the function I create another function called getAlbums. In here is where I actually make the call via the get command. You'll also notice that I'm using promises that is also provided by AngularJS.</p><p>Here's another part of where AngularJS's data binding comes into play. Remember the <em>ng-model&nbsp;</em>of "artist" we had in our text box? That was bound to the <em>$scope&nbsp;</em>and was used in the call to Jamendo. That's all we had to do.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6956281.js?file=AlbumController.js"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2>Enabling CORS</h2><p>You may have noticed that you haven't seen where I create the "jamendoApp" module in the controller. This is because, after some reading and viewing others code, I created a base app.js file that handles that as well as some config and routing settings that will be used throughout the whole application.</p><p>Also another thing to make note of is that, since I'm using AngularJS to make a third party call to get data most browsers may not allow the call to take place due to having to enable <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-Origin_Resource_Sharing" target="_blank">cross-origin resource sharing</a>. If you tried to make the same call without enabling CORS you would get a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Same_origin_policy" target="_blank">same-origin policy</a> error. This basically allows the browser to only access resources that are in the same domain as the page you're calling from. To get around this I got help from this StackOverflow <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/17756550/angularjs-cors-issues" target="_blank">question</a>&nbsp;and implemented the configuration below.&nbsp;</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6956281.js?file=App.js"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2>Demo</h2><p>To demo how it all works GitHub makes it super easy to view HTML pages from our repositories using an HTML Preview. Simply go to this <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jwood803/JamendoAngular/blob/master/index.html" target="_blank">page</a>&nbsp;to interact with it and feel free to come back and let me know what you think about it.</p><p></p><p><span>Full code to play with can be found on the GitHub</span><span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://github.com/jwood803/JamendoAngular">repository</a><span>.</span>&nbsp;</p><p>Next time we'll refactor the controller and have our API call from a AngularJS service.</p>

      <title>Mastering .NET Debugging….or Trying To</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/04/03/mastering-net-debugging-or-trying-to</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>For two days this week I’ve had the privilege of taking another training <a href="http://www.wintellect.com//Training/Courses/Mastering-.NET-Debugging/" target="_blank">course</a> from <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/" target="_blank">Wintellect</a> and <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jrobbins/default.aspx" target="_blank">John Robbins</a> (author of a still very relevant <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Microsoft-NET-2-0-Applications/dp/0735622027/ref=sr_sp-atf_title_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1365215166&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=debugging+applications+.net+2" target="_blank">debugging book</a>) was the instructor. Based on the title of this post, the course was on .NET debugging. I thought I’d give my thoughts on this course and my experiences with Wintellect’s training in general.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Day 1</h2>
<p>This day was mainly focusing on debugging through Visual Studio and slightly changing your processes in how you do daily development and coding, such as more advanced breakpoints. One of the things that I didn’t quite expect to learn was about code analysis. I have used FxCop as a stand-alone tool before a few times, but now it seems that as of Visual Studio 2012 (that I’ve noticed) it’s built into the IDE. This is definitely the quickest thing to incorporate into your daily routine. Once I was back in the office turning on code analysis was the first thing I started changing. Another aspect from this day was how versatile the watch window is. I used to use the immediate window if I needed to run a quick statement, but switching to the watch window seems to be a better choice. It’s much easier to explore the object I evaluated and it’s members.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Day 2</h2>
<p>Now this is where it was getting more fun. I’ve been interested in learning more about how to use WinDBG plenty of times in the past but, in all honesty, each time I’ve tried it’s just gotten so overwhelming that it didn’t last very long. Sure there are actually tons of resources now to help, but if you get to a point where you have no idea how the author was able to find how they got a memory address or explained how they knew how to go from one command to the other, you’re just going to get lost. With this course, however, if I got to that point, all I had to do was just ask and it was explained very clearly. That’s one of the reasons I like these so much, it’s like having your own personal mentor for a day or two. Now I feel like I have a decent understanding of at least what I can do to start doing some of this myself. Take a random memory dump and see what I can find by exploring. John even went over a few interesting items related to performance, as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This course definitely makes me feel much more confident in my debugging skills and I hope to use all the items learned from here to their full extent. Of course, one thing I’ve learned recently – if John Robbins tells me how to code, that’s how I’m going to code. :]</p>

      <title>On Better Developer Testing</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/04/06/on-better-developer-testing</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I read an interesting <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2013/03/04/test-better.aspx" target="_blank">post</a> by <a href="http://haacked.com/" target="_blank">Phil Haack</a> a little while ago on having developers do better testing themselves instead of relying solely on their QA team to test. While it’s definitely a great read in itself, I felt I had to add my opinion to it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong with this, though. I think the more experience and skill a developer has on testing their own code, the more valuable they actually are. Also, it’ll mean their code is that much more reliable and stable upon initial release all the way through to production. No developer wants to find that their code somehow broke in production the morning after it was deployed and spend that whole day fixing it. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While I definitely agree with Phil on most of his arguments, there was one thought about the whole thing that kept coming to mind about myself, personally, when testing stuff that I’ve written. I know I don’t have the experience to think of a good amount of scenarios the code will be hit at. Now, this may not be an issue for the more experienced developers out there, but I know it’s a weak point of mine. I’ve definitely been bit by not doing more of this in the past and, indeed, it wasn’t fun admitting it was my fault when the manager is asking what happened. In fact, when this happened to me it gave me a very real benefit of using unit tests. Of course, unit tests can’t test everything that a user would do as input or processes on a screen. While Phil notes that Test Driven Design is mainly for the initial design of the code we’re ultimately testing, it definitely helps to make sure any refactorings for readability, maintainability, performance, etc. didn’t break anything we’ve already shown and trust to be correct.</p>

      <title>WinDBG Beginner Sessions: Part 0</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/04/07/windbg-beginner-sessions-part-0</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>In an earlier <a target="_blank" href="/blog/2013/04/03/mastering-net-debugging-or-trying-to">post</a> where I mentioned I took a very informative training course from <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/" target="_blank">Wintellect</a>, I thought I’d use this blog to help keep track of what I’ve been studying and to kind of have a bit of a “peer review” of this stuff that I’m trying to learn. Although, before beginning, we still need to set up our environment. Personally, I prefer to have a dark background with a green text, a la the old terminal days. It just seems the easiest on my eyes and easiest to read.
Below is a small list of the color changes I made to my base workstation. I leave the prompt command text white so I can differentiate when I set in a command vs. any output from WinDBG.</p>
<table width="706" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="449">
<p align="center">Setting Name</p>
</td>
<td valign="top" width="255">
<p align="center">Color</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="449">Background</td>
<td valign="top" width="255">Black</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="449">Text</td>
<td valign="top" width="255">Green</td>

<p>And here is a small sample screenshot of it in action:</p>

      <title>WinDBG Beginner Sessions: Part 1 - Hang</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/04/08/windbg-beginner-sessions-part-1-hang</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>We got through the exhibition <a target="_blank" href="/blog/2013/04/07/windbg-beginner-sessions-part-0">post</a>, but now it’s time to get serious. I figured the quickest way to get going here is to go through <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tess/" target="_blank">Tess Ferrandez’s</a> series of debugging <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tess/archive/2008/02/04/net-debugging-demos-information-and-setup-instructions.aspx" target="_blank">labs</a>. I’ve heard that these are actually some of the best tutorials and hands-on experience you can get with WinDBG, so I’m excited to get started.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the reasons I’ve waited so long to do this is due to the labs having the demo site setup in IIS. I’m definitely not the best at deploying and configuring IIS, so instead here I used IIS Express. This seems to work quite well so I’ll be sticking with that throughout the labs. So let’s get started with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tess/archive/2008/02/04/net-debugging-demos-lab-1-hang.aspx" target="_blank">lab 1 – the hang</a>.</p>
<p>The first part of the lab was to recreate the issue. Since TinyGet appears to be dead, I just manually hit refresh on the browser windows. While that was going I ran the following command to get a dump file while going to the page in question:</p>
<pre class="csharpcode">.\procdump.exe -n 2 iisexpress.exe</pre>
<p>Unfortunately, I forgot to generate the dump using the -ma switch, so no memory information will be available. I swear to remember to use this from now on!</p>
<p>Based on the suggestion of the lab, running the ~* kb 2000 command. Ok, so after some searches, I'm still not exactly sure what this command is saying, but here's a shot in the dark:</p>
<ul>
<li>~* will execute the following command towards all threads.</li>
<li>kb will print out the native (non-.NET) call stack.</li>
<li>2000…well, here’s where I'm lost. If anyone out there happens to know, please let me know. </li>
</ul>
<p>And the results of this is the below. Let's see, it appears that most of these threads are just in a waiting state.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9cdf/1365453596000/clip_image001.png?format=original"><img title="clip_image001" height="551" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" alt="clip_image001" width="1027" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9ce2/1365453601000/clip_image001_thumb.png?format=original" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Oh, but after some scrolling, thread 28 has something interesting.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9cea/1365453603000/clip_image002.png?format=original"><img title="clip_image002" height="681" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" alt="clip_image002" width="1026" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9cee/1365453609000/clip_image002_thumb.png?format=original" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at this thread and switch the debugger to it with the ~28s command. Then, we'll check out the managed call stack with the !ClrStack command.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9cf1/1365453614000/clip_image003.png?format=original"><img title="clip_image003" height="444" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" alt="clip_image003" width="1138" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9cf4/1365453618000/clip_image003_thumb.png?format=original" border="0"></a></p>
<p>See anything here? Talk about interesting, this thread is sleeping! Well, that's about all the commands I can think to run for this. Tess' lab suggests to run the !syncblk command, however, when I ran it I get the below.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9cf7/1365453619000/clip_image004.png?format=original"><img title="clip_image004" height="46" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" alt="clip_image004" width="338" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ae4b0fe422ebb9cfa/1365453620000/clip_image004_thumb.png?format=original" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Perhaps that's due to the fact that it isn't a full dump? Regardless, I think we have more than enough information from our dump here. Now, let's check the code that the !ClrStack command has given us. It's telling us to check out the DataLayer.GetFeaturedProducts() method, so let's take a look.</p>
<p>And look what we have.</p>
<p><a href="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469be4b0fe422ebb9cfd/1365453621000/clip_image005.png?format=original"><img title="clip_image005" height="195" style="background-image:none;padding-top:0;padding-left:0;display:inline;padding-right:0;border-width:0;" alt="clip_image005" width="442" src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469be4b0fe422ebb9d00/1365453622000/clip_image005_thumb.png?format=original" border="0"></a></p>
<p>Of course, looking back at the actual <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/tess/archive/2008/02/06/net-debugging-demos-lab-1-hang-review.aspx" target="_blank">walkthrough</a> of the lab, I missed a bit without the !synblk command. I’m definitely going to redo this with an actual full dump to see if I can find the thread that is being blocked and the thread that’s doing the blocking. I got a bit lucky on this one, I think.</p>

      <title>Debugger Display using ToString()</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/05/10/debugger-display-using-tostring</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>One of the things as a .NET developer that I tend to do most while debugging is to traverse through objects and their properties to see what values they have. Of course, the Base Class Library has something to help us do this even faster and more efficient – DebuggerDisplay attribute.
Let’s say you’re tasked to help an insurance company write an updated application to determine the rate based off certain attributes on the car, such as age and number of collisions. It may look something like the following:</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329778.js?file=CarClass.cs"></script>



  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="337"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1377126049126-JOSSSM183KW3KJWCMLD6/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=" Showing regular object debugging. "/>  Showing regular object debugging. [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>And while debugging you want to see the properties, Visual Studio will show you something similar to the below.&nbsp; Not bad, but we can do a bit better with the DebuggerDisplay attribute. Let’s see how this gets used. With the same class definition that we had earlier, we just add the DebuggerDisplay attribute to the class. To access any of the properties, just enclose them in “{ }”.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329778.js?file=DebuggerDisplay.cs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>And our result is the below. Note that you can still expand out the object for other properties as well.</p>
</div>

























  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="302"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1377126049245-9B7C82TPDG7EBI0RV2G6/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=" Debugging the object with DebuggerDisplay "/>  Debugging the object with DebuggerDisplay [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Now, this alone can help out, but we can also run methods in the DebuggerDisplay attribute. Let’s override our ToString method of our class and use that. Note that the “nq” in the attribute is for “no quote” which will remove the quotes from the resulting string.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329778.js?file=CarWithToString.cs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>And, as you can see, we get the ToString() result in our debugger tool tip.</p>
</div>

























  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="308"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1377126049207-1X4SAC3J0S4GKRMKR4OJ/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=" Debugging object using DebuggerDisplay with ToString() "/>  Debugging object using DebuggerDisplay with ToString() [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Of course, there are other reasons why you would want to override the ToString method in your own classes, but hopefully now you know just one more way you can use it. Have fun debugging, everyone!</p>

      <title>A Thought on Legacy Code</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/05/11/a-thought-on-legacy-code</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I’m quite sure that during one’s career as a software developer they may have the pleasure of maintaining legacy code. Of course, I personally define legacy code as a project that has absolutely no tests. Most of the time, though, this may be a fairly old project. If that developer has been in the career at least a couple of years, then one of the first things they may say to themselves about this type of project is how bad the code and/or the design is. I, myself, have also done this quite a few times.</p>
<p>However, something has occurred to me while I was updating, not one, but three of these types of projects. Indeed, there’s code in these that I still wonder who in their right mind would have written. At this point I had a sort of an epiphany: this wasn’t a bad thing, this is what helps to make me a better developer. The main reason I believe this is that, since I actually enjoy writing unit tests, I concentrate on making the code testable and write as many tests as I can. Only then will I proceed to make the requested enhancement or fix. The project is actually better for that and you just did something that someone else deemed or was just flat out told that they didn’t have time or the energy to do.</p>
<p>In conclusion to this small rant, don’t always hate on having to update legacy code. It can be to your best benefit as a developer and what you learn from that can last quite a while in your development career.</p>

      <title>Using PowerShell to Help Debug Third Party Dependencies</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/07/25/using-powershell-to-help-debug-third-party-dependencies</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I hate when an application has a third party dependency (web service, url, ftp, etc.) mainly because it’s hard to test or even see what data you’re getting back. However, this is one awesome reason to love PowerShell. PowerShell can be used to make those calls manually so you can see what comes back and, if needed, use that data further while doing tests.
For example, you have a call that gives XML has a response and use PowerShell to traverse the response using the new Invoke-WebRequest cmdlet in PowerShell v3. I’ll use the MSDN blog RSS feed as a small example here.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329806.js?file=ThirdPartyCall.ps1"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>However, PowerShell makes it easier for us to traverse the XML by putting all the nodes into properties. For that, we need to put the results into an XML typed variable.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329806.js?file=UsingWebCallResults.ps1"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>And with the above we get these results:</p>
</div>

























  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1033"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1377126049231-H8ZNGYTDH939Q2CLZD7X/image_thumb.png?format=original" alt=" image "/>  image [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>And from there you can use the results anyway you need to to help test and/or debug that part of your application. This recently just helped me out of a bit of a bind.</p>

      <title>Why You Should Use OneNote</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/01/why-you-should-use-onenote</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Very rarely will I push a piece of software that I believe people should use. Of course, what software you do use is quite a personal choice. However, there are pure gems out there that I just can't let it stay unknown for much longer to everyone I believe can benefit from it. <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote/">Microsoft OneNote</a> is the one I consider a true gem.
What can you do with it, exactly? Well, you can use it to write/draw/screen cap anything you'd like! It's a blank canvas for you to use however you wish. Why would you use it? It basically gives you a virtual notebook and you can organize it how you would like, though it keeps with the traditional notebook organizational hierarchy such as tabs (or sections) and pages. There are even some <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/onenote-help/apply-a-template-to-a-page-HA102749818.aspx">templates </a>to help get you started such as to-do lists, travel plans, shopping lists, etc. However, I use it to literally take notes. Whether it's for studying, notes from various readings, or just random thoughts that go through my head.</p>
<p><img height="270" alt="" width="958" class=" " src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/52154697e4b0fe422ebb9ca8/5215469ce4b0fe422ebb9d4e/1375295640000/onenote11.png?format=original" /></p>
<p>As you can tell from above screenshot, I just break my notebooks out by general category and break the sections and their pages up to be more specific. You may also notice that you can nest pages to create a bit of a hierarchy.</p>
<p>Of course, what's the use of all these notes if you can't get to them easily. OneNote has a great search feature. You can either search throughout the one page or through the whole notebook. If you have a Windows 8 tablet with a pen, you can download the Windows RT OneNote app and you can take handwritten notes and OneNote will search those as well!</p>
<p>There is also a mobile app regardless of what type of phone you have. So you can have all your notes available to you at any time. One great way to use this is to have an easy access to a page you have set up for random thoughts, idea, or something you'd like to take a further look at later.</p>
<p>The only downside I have about OneNote is that it's not the best for clipping web articles. Sure it's nice to be able to save links, but I believe it's best to be able to clip the entire article into OneNote. That way you won't be dependent on if that article or even the site is still available. For web clippings I do use <a href="http://evernote.com/">Evernote </a>and their web clipper. Hopefully in a future update this can be done straight through OneNote itself.</p>
<p>If you want to get more organized with your notes or random findings, I suggest giving OneNote a try. Who knows, you may find it as useful as I do.</p>

      <title>Watch How Your Users Use Your App</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/07/watch-how-your-users-use-your-app</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>If you develop applications at your company and another group there uses it to do the actual business of the company, have you actually seen how they use the software?
Seems a bit crazy, right? You developed it, so of course you know how it works! Not quite so. The people who use your applications all day every day at work will find little nuances about it that you never would have dreamed of. They'll take six clicks to get something done when you thought it only would take two.</p>
<p>You won't really know how they use it until you sit with them and watch them for a few minutes. Requesting this to your boss should show that you care enough about the business to help out the productivity of the users and the quality of the software you give to them. To get an even better idea is to see if you can actually do a little bit of what they do to get the full effect. Then take notes...anything that comes to mind. How do you think this can be improved? What issues were you having to accomplish a certain task? Were there any performance problems that had you waiting for a task to complete? Could something be done simpler to minimize the user (in this case, you) from having to think about what should be done on the page?</p>
<p>I actually propose the whole team to do this. Then once everyone has finished, compare notes and even have a small meeting on all the things that can be improved.</p>
<p>I just did this today and saw massive productivity improvements and you can bet I'll share them with the team as soon as I review my notes.</p>

      <title>Using TraceSource for Logging</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/11/using-tracesource-for-logging</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>How often have you been in a project and you wanted to create a simple log file to log out errors and, if debugging an annoying error, parameter and variable values?
I've wanted to do this a few times but there are a handful of references out there on how best to use TraceSource for logging. Of course you have your best resources of <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228984.aspx">MSDN </a>and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4376699/how-to-use-tracesource-across-classes">StackOverflow</a>, but I figured a bit more of an understandable example would be most helpful to everyone looking on how to easily implement this to their projects.</p><p>To get started in the simplest way, all you need to do is to update the config file to include the System.Diagnostics section and then update the code you want to log out the information that you want. Below is a similar example to what is shown on the previously mentioned MSDN article.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329425.js?file=TraceSourceConfig.xml"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>You may have noticed that I'm calling the Flush() and Close() methods on the TraceSource object. This is done to make sure the file gets written to and is closed properly. If you aren't getting everything written to your listener, these calls may be all that's needed. However, I've seen cases where it's not always required.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329425.js?file=TraceSourceLogging.cs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>TraceSource can be used across layers of the application as well and you can create a source for each of the layers to do a bit of a separated logging. So if you have a wrapper class you wouldn't want to log as much as you might a business class that has all your business logic.</p><p>Of course, if you push to production and don't want all this logging until you need it, you can turn it off per the switch inside of the specific source.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329425.js?file=SetTraceSourceConfigOff.xml"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>To show how it's used for different classes, I'll use a standard Person/Employee class hierarchy. So below we have our two new classes:</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329425.js?file=CustomLoggingWithTraceSource.cs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Fairly basic classes here with some similarly basic methods. As you can tell with the methods, I’m logging some fairly verbose information out. So if there any problems with certain data, I can just look at the logs to see what the methods are using and their return value. This can be crucial in debugging a certain item when you have a decent sized data set. If this wasn’t available you’d then have to go through each item in the data set by hand.</p><p>To separate out the log for each class or even a whole layer in your app, just create a new source for each layer you want to be logged separately. I’m using the same listener so they’ll all go to the same place, but you’re free to have each source have it’s own listener.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6329425.js?file=MultipleTraceSourceConfig.xml"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>And now you have your information logged:<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>
























<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>This is just a basic use of TraceSource for logging information. I used a file to log out because I feel that it’s fairly easy to use and you have one location for all your log statements. If you’re used to log4net with the different additional appenders (listeners in terms of using TraceSource), then the&nbsp;<a href="http://essentialdiagnostics.codeplex.com/">Essential Diagnostics</a>&nbsp;library will be a great addition to the project to further enhance using TraceSource for logging.</p><p>The full source for this example can be viewed on GitHub –&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Chrono803/TraceSourceLogging">TraceSourceLogging</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Current Project Queue</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/14/current-project-queue</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Like any developer, (who actually likes doing development, anyway) I tend to have some projects outside of work going. Of course, more often than not, they don't always get completed. Some don't even get started! I'd like to change that. This blog (and hopefully all two of you readers) can help keep me accountable. So here are the projects I currently have an idea on doing and what I plan on learning. Don't worry, I'll release the source for this stuff as they get completed.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Web app to use the Jamendo API</strong> - Wanted to play with the API (which helps me learn to consume JSON) for some time now. Plan on creating an ASP.NET MVC web application and use Angular.JS for the two-way data-binding (of course, mess with the testing and IoC within Angular.JS).</li>
<li><strong>Learn more design patterns </strong>- I've stayed away from learning design patterns but no longer! I think it's time to learn these and I'll be using PluralSight's <a href="http://www.pluralsight.com/training/Courses/TableOfContents/patterns-library">Design Pattern Library</a> course to help me out.</li>
<li><b>Something with the Kinect</b> - Not exactly sure what to do with the Kinect just yet, but I wanted to develop an app to interact with some hardware and this seems like a simple yet fun way to do so.</li>
<li><strong>More JavaScript</strong> - This is the number one thing I need to learn more of, currently. When JavaScript is <a href="http://readwrite.com/2013/08/09/why-javascript-will-become-the-dominant-programming-language-of-the-enterprise">considered</a> the most dominant language now, it's a good time to learn more of it.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just a list of the more important stuff I wanted to do. I'm sure more stuff will definitely be to come.</p>

      <title>Podcasts Are Back...For Me, At Least</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/18/podcasts-are-back-for-me-at-least</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I still remember back at around 2006 or so while still getting over the breakup of the best television network ever created, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TechTV">TechTV</a>, I find out about this fairly new thing call podcasts. This was big back then, especially since the people I loved watching on TechTV came together for their own podcast, <a href="http://twit.tv/">This Week in Tech</a> (TWiT). I believe this is still one of the most popular podcasts still around.
While I think the TWiT network has some of the best podcast shows out there I have a few others that I get excited to see to have new episodes.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.hanselminutes.com/" target="_blank">Hanselminutes</a> – <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/" target="_blank">Scott Hanselman</a> is one of <em>the</em> guys to follow if you’re doing any kind of development using the Microsoft technology stack and his podcast is just as good. Usually Scott has a guest on to talk about a certain topic and it’s always informative.</li>
<li><a href="http://getupandcode.com/" target="_blank">Get Up and Code</a> – A fairly recent addition, this is a good one for anyone who wants to get more into fitness and nutrition, and it's not just for developers as the name suggests.</li>
<li><a href="http://lifehacker.com/tag/podcast" target="_blank">Lifehacker</a> – The popular life hacking blog has their own podcast that highlights the popular posts of the week.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/" target="_blank">This American Life</a> – Probably the biggest podcast currently still going on that has a theme for each show and true stories based on thattheme.</li>
</ul>
<p>Speaking of the TWiT network, they do have quite a library of shows. Here are my current favorites.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-tech" target="_blank">This Week in Tech</a> – The podcast that started it all. This is still the popular one of tech podcasts and definitely a fan favorite of many TechTV fans.</li>
<li><a href="http://twit.tv/show/tech-news-today" target="_blank">Tech News Today</a> – What better way to get tech news than a daily podcast?</li>
<li><a href="http://twit.tv/show/the-tech-guy" target="_blank">The Tech Guy</a> – <a href="http://leoville.com/bio" target="_blank">Leo Laporte’s</a> weekend radio show where he helps callers with their tech questions.</li>
<li><a href="http://twit.tv/show/this-week-in-law" target="_blank">This Week in Law</a> – I've always had an interest in law and this show plugs that gap in for me in an easily digestible format.</li>
<li><a href="http://twit.tv/show/triangulation" target="_blank">Triangulation</a> – An interview type show that lets you get to know people in tech.</li>
<li><a href="http://twit.tv/show/windows-weekly" target="_blank">Windows Weekly</a> – A weekly show about all things Microsoft!</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s quite a lot of shows. They usually come out once a week so that’s basically a week’s worth of entertainment right there. I’m sure there’s tons of other awesome shows out there that I have yet to discover and I can’t wait until I do get to discover them.</p>

      <title>Learning Python Using IronPython</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/08/21/learning-python-using-ironpython</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Not too long ago when browsing the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> courses I found an interesting <a href="https://www.coursera.org/#course/programming1" target="_blank">one</a> about learning to program using the Python programming language. Once I saw this I jumped right on it and installed <a href="http://ironpython.net/" target="_blank">IronPython</a>, a .NET library that lets you use Python to interact with .NET applications.
Unfortunately, I never really finished all the assignments. I got a bit stuck with converting a .NET List object to a Python List object. I believe I finally got the program to actually do the conversion, but my test would still fail for some reason (any insights on this would be awesome).</p><p>The code for IronPython that really does the work in my project is in the PythonEngine class.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6302038.js"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>As you can see, it’s taking in a parameter for the location of the Python script file for it to execute. From there the engine compiles the file and executes it. I get the variable (or method in this case) by the name and then I send it the list of parameters and invoke it getting back the results that are returned as a dynamic type.</p><p>One of the cool things you can do with IronPython and using the dynamic keyword is that, if your app has a different set of rules, you can create the rules within the Python script and use the C# to invoke them. This way only the Python script will need to be updated for the logic of the rules and no compiling of the C# is needed to execute the new rule set.</p><p>This course was a fairly easy introduction to the Python language and I believe it’ll be offered again fairly soon on the Coursera site, if you’re interested in taking it. Using it with IronPython also shows how powerful it can be in enterprise applications as well as how much power using the dynamic keyword can be.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I'll be honest, I've been excited about this book since I heard about it's release a couple of months ago. I consider <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian">Alexis Ohanian</a>&nbsp;to be a true defender of internet freedom and of all the good things that can come from it. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455520020/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1455520020&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId=ebf022f0f2456d477349851aa7e1868f">Without Their Permission</a> definitely highlights some of the most recent awesome things that have come from the internet being free where anyone can create a site for their passion.</p>

  <h2>What's Inside?</h2><p>The book is divided into three basic parts - how Alexis co-founded <a target="_blank" href="http://www.reddit.com/">reddit</a>&nbsp;-&nbsp;one of the most visited web sites today, a few examples of other websites that are changing the world, and how anyone else can do the same.</p><p>The story of how reddit was started was itself an interesting tale and perhaps even one that can be its own book since it's also an inspiring read. Who would have thought that one of the most popular web sites may never have existed.</p><p>Alexis gives a few examples of other websites that set out to help the world be a better place. With sites like <a target="_blank" href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">Kickstarter</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.donorschoose.org/">DonorsChoose</a>, it's hard not to see that people really want to help...and they do. I've participated in both, myself and it is, indeed, very rewarding just knowing that I played a part in helping out.</p><p>In fact, with DonorsChoose you can get the added reward of thank you notes directly from the students of the class in which you supported. It gives the reward a bit more of a personal touch. Below is one that I've gotten recently and I can't express what I felt when I read through them.</p>
</div>






















<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jonwood/11224095656" title="Thank you note by Jon Wood, on Flickr"><img src="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2886/11224095656_6dd03913df_n.jpg" width="320" height="240" alt="Thank you note"></a></p>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p><span>The third part is where Alexis gives his advice on how anyone can create something without anyone's permission. He gives the advice based on his own experience as well as the experience when he did his investments to other web sites who he feels will help the world. He even gives ideas on how to learn to code if you've never done it before.</span></p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>It didn't take me long at all to finish this book as it was an easy read. It even made me laugh a few times. I'll definitely keep this on the book shelf and will even re-read it several times.</p><p>If you're looking to start something this book will definitely be a good kick in the right direction. It even felt like the book made me want to start something at the moment I was reading it. It's not just for people wanting to start a business, it's for people wanting to start anything.</p><h2>Bonus</h2><p>Alexis has done quite a bit for the community as a whole. To help introduce you to his work here are a couple of things he's done.</p><p>TED Talk about social media and the power of community.</p>

      <title>Core C#: Delegates</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/19/core-c-delegates</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Microsoft has made it easier for aspiring developers to easily get started creating something when they came out with the C# language. However, there are definitely some advanced aspects of the language that take quite a bit longer than others to fully grasp. Delegates is one of those types of language features. Hopefully by the end of this article you'll have a deeper understanding of how utilize delegates in your C# code.&nbsp;</p><p>I, myself, had trouble trying to fully understand what the purpose of delegates were. If you were to ask me before what a delegate was, I would just give a small answer indicating that it's similar to a method template. While that's true, it does quite a bit more.</p><p>The simplest way I know to go over delegates is to just go through a small example to allow you to also do the same so you can use that to experiment around with the code.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/7129103.js?file=DelegateKeyword.cs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Let's go through this a bit. The first line is where you actually declare the delegate and give it a return type, name, and any parameters if it needs any. In our <em>Main </em>method is where we'll initiate a couple of variables to hold the delegates. The first one, <em>myDelegate</em>&nbsp;, does so using the method syntax. Our second variable, however, we declare it using an anonymous delegate, or a delegate without a function name.</p><p>After we've declared the our variables with our delegate, we can then invoke our delegate by calling it just like a method just like in lines 15 and 16 above. We declared our delegate to take in a single string parameter, so that's how we'll invoke it.&nbsp;</p><h3>Built in Delegate Types<span style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: normal; line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></h3><p>The folks at Microsoft were kind enough to give us a few built in delegates that we can also use within our code. Let's take a quick look at them.<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/7129103.js?file=BuiltInDelegates.cs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>The first one, which may be the most commonly used, especially if you've messed quite a bit with the LINQ method syntax, is the <em>Func</em>&nbsp; delegate type. This one will take in zero or more parameters and will return something back to the caller. In the example above I have one parameter of a string and I return back an integer.</p><p>The second one is the <em>Action</em> delegate type. Like the <em>Func</em> type it takes in zero or more parameters, however it returns void (returns nothing).</p><p>The third one, <em>Predicate</em>, is a bit closer to the <em>Func</em> type where it takes in parameters and returns. The difference with this is that it will always return a boolean true or false back to the caller.<br></p><h3>Invocation Lists</h3><p></p><p>One of the magic things that delegates have is they keep track of all invocations of it. When we instantiate our delegates we are actually adding to the invocation list. Another way to do this is to simply add a delegate to another delegate.<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/7129103.js?file=DelegateInvocation.cs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>We'll see the true power of delegates and their invocation lists in the next part, when we talk about events.</p>

      <title>Book Review: Masters of Doom</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/10/7/book-review-masters-of-doom</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>If you were like me and you grew up in the 90s and played any sort of video games then I'm sure you've played Wolfenstein 3D or Doom. Though, regardless if you were into gaming, these games probably marked the beginning of an era in computing in general.</p><p>I've heard about this book when I just happened to find it on <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0812972155/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0812972155&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId=2328a3fb6cc9fac59f2547f55efd09aa">Amazon</a>, but what wanted me to read it was that it is apparently the book that helped Alexis Ohanian <a target="_blank" href="http://alexisohanian.com/the-book-that-inspired-the-birth-of-reddit">want to start a company</a>&nbsp;so it actually helped make reddit a reality.&nbsp; After finding that out I thought I just had to read this book.</p><p>What just starts out as a few guys who just want to make games that they themselves wanted to play soon turns into an empire.&nbsp;Instantly I can tell this is another nonfiction book that just reads so much like a novel. It starts off with telling the early stories of the Two Johns, <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/romero">John Romero</a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/ID_AA_Carmack">John Carmack</a>. About their gaming passion and how they got into programming games, and early on you can tell that they were destined to create their own masterpieces. After a little while creating and developing games for a small company they get the itch to create their own company. With Romero's creative ideas and Carmack's programming talent, they definitely have what it takes. They created <a target="_blank" href="http://www.idsoftware.com/">id Software</a>.</p><p>With the help of a few others they recruited, they were able to make their first game Commander Keen. Now I remember playing this back in the Windows 3.1 days and I had no idea it was id who created the game. Their next big title was Wolfenstein 3D. I still have memories of when I first played this and I'm sure, like myself, it the first time others have played a first person shooter. Their next blockbuster is perhaps the one they're most famous for, Doom. I think it was the first time I was hesitant to open a door in a game because I wasn't sure what was behind it.</p><p> </p><p>Of course, there were some inner struggles within the small company that the book goes over as well. Eventually a few of them left to pursue other interests, but their initial passion of creating great games never ceased.</p><p>This was definitely a joy to read and, if you're a developer as well, you may just get a little interest in graphics or game programming yourself.</p>

      <title>Small Change: Disqus Comments</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>After noticing that more and more blogs and other web content are moving toward using <a href="http://disqus.com/" target="_blank">Disqus</a>&nbsp;as their medium for comments, I thought it would be best to move mine over to the platform as well.</p><p>The main advantage I wanted to gain for the readers here is that there is one less thing for them to have to register and/or worry about following. With Disqus, you have all your comments and actionable items in one place and users have the ability to even use it via a login from other social media sites. It's a total win-win situation!&nbsp;</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>

      <title>Small Introduction to AngularJS</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/22/intro-to-angularjs</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I know what you're probably thinking, "Oh, another JavaScript library/framework for me to learn." Well, yes, that's correct. However, I believe this is one worth learning.&nbsp;</p><p>Why this one over the many other ones available to you? AngularJS has a different approach. Instead of providing a library, it's goal is to make HTML dynamic like most modern web sites are instead of being the old, boring static HTML we're all used to.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when you first see AngularJS in action, it can look pretty weird. That can be said of a lot of libraries, frameworks, or technologies until you get used to it. I was the same thing when I first started messing with lambdas in .NET.</p><p>Below is a small example for AngularJS mostly showing controllers and some basic data binding.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6405598.js?file=Index.html"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>At first, you may notice all the <em>ng-*&nbsp;</em>attributes in the HTML. This is all AngularJS and, as mentioned above, it extends HTML to be more dynamic. The double curly braces ( {{ }} ) tell Angular that it's a two way binding. Inside the braces is the name on the model to use. You can also tell that most of the functions and properties are in the EmployeeController JavaScript file, which we'll take a look at next.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6405598.js?file=EmployeeController.js"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>The first line tells what application Angular will be using. This is the same as the <em>ng-app</em>&nbsp; attribute in the HTML. The empty array will be for any dependencies we may need, such as additional JavaScript files. The next section is where we're defining the actual EmployeeController, which sets our initial Employee object and defines the add and remove methods. These methods get called in their appropriate places inside the HTML. You may notice we also pass in the <em>$scope</em> object into our controller function. This is mainly for AngularJS and can be used for dependency injection later on, if you need it.</p><p>Below is the full demo in action. Note that JSFiddle automatically puts in the <em>html </em>tag, so I had to wrap the <em>body </em>tag with the <em>ng-app</em> attribute for Angular to work correctly.</p>
</div>






















<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/jwood803/WGsey/5/embedded/js,html,result" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h3>Additional Resources</h3><p>The one tutorial that got me started on the path of Angular is <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/" target="_blank">Dan Wahlin's</a> <a href="http://youtu.be/i9MHigUZKEM" target="_blank">AngularJS in 60ish Minutes</a>.</p><p>Another good tutorial is the one from <a href="http://www.thinkster.io/" target="_blank">Thinkster</a>.&nbsp; They combine a lot of the articles and tutorials from all over and give them all to you piece by piece along with their own videos.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p></p><p><strong></strong>This was just a&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp; small introduction to AngularJS. While there are tons of other things you can do, this should be good to get something up and going. Once a little bit is understood, the tutorials and all will make so much more sense and you will be able to learn a bit more than you did before. Hope you enjoy learning AngularJS as much as I have!<i><em></em></i></p>

      <title>You Are Good Enough</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/22/you-are-good-enough</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>"I don't think I'm a good developer."&nbsp;</p><p>I think a lot of developers out there think this or something similar at one point in their career. Mainly during the first few years when they started out. Maybe they just started their first job or even thinking of moving to a second job.</p><p>Here's my advice if you're one of those who think this...just relax.</p><p>Yes, I definitely have done this myself. All through college, when interviewing for my first job, during my first job, interviewing for my second, and during the first couple of months of my second. Seems like a lot of times worrying and doubting yourself, doesn't it?&nbsp;</p><p>It's kind of nice that you worry about this stuff. It means you actually care, right? But just think, if you weren't as good as you may think, how would you have gotten the job you do now? How would you have been able to stay there for as long as you have?&nbsp;</p><p>If you still feel the same about your skill, take this opportunity to learn new stuff. The internet has tons of stuff online to get you started. One tutorial doesn't make sense? Go to the next one.</p><p>So go on, challenge yourself. After doing that you'll become better than good enough.</p><p></p><p></p>

      <title>Code Katas Can Be Helpful</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/28/code-katas-can-be-fun</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>After reading a <a href="http://simpleprogrammer.com/2013/08/26/dont-code-katas/" target="_blank">few</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://irisclasson.com/2013/09/11/stupid-question-238-239-should-i-do-code-katas-and-what-is-a-kata/" target="_blank">posts</a> in the development community lately about code katas, I felt I should put out my own opinion about the subject.<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">&nbsp;</span></p><p>At work, a few of us developers decided to take a couple of lunches each week and get together to work on a <a href="http://codekata.pragprog.com/" target="_blank">code kata</a> that we all decide on prior to the meetings. This was mainly so we can increase our skills in development, but mainly it was a way for us to use a new or not so familiar language for a fairly small coding project.</p><p></p><p>For our first shot at a kata we decided to try&nbsp;<a href="http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataPokerHands" target="_blank">Poker Hands</a>&nbsp;(you're always welcome to view my <a href="https://github.com/jwood803/Katas" target="_blank">progress</a>), which we had to rank two player's poker hand and determine who won and display how they won (high card or higher set of cards). Not exactly the easiest kata to do, especially when doing it in a language you're definitely not familiar with, but we thought it was one that could give us a good challenge.<br></p><p>Another aspect to doing katas is to do solve very small problems. One of my favorite ways to do this lately is by playing around at <a href="http://www.codewars.com/" target="_blank">Code Wars</a>. I've been messing with the JavaScript and Ruby katas there and have been learning quite a lot about the languages as each new kata I do gets progressively harder. They have a pretty slick interface, as well.</p><p>I feel this site does a lot of things right. Most importantly, once you've successfully finished a kata it will also display how others have successfully implemented it. Looking though those can help see how other people use the language to their advantage.</p><p>Sure, you can also be doing other things in order to learn, such as messing around GitHub for a project to contribute to or volunteering. However, a big benefit to doing these small katas is because they are small compared to these other types of projects. You won't feel as overwhelmed by the size of the project or try to figure out where to start. Here you just create the appropriate class or function and make sure all the tests pass.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you want to do code katas because you believe they help and because you find them enjoyable. I feel like I'm learning new languages little by little the more I do these.&nbsp;<span>I seem to have rekindled my love of programming just by doing these katas.</span><span>&nbsp;I hope I'm not the only one</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">.</span></p>

      <title>YUI: The Other JavaScript Framework</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/8/30/yui-ithe-other-framework</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>When you think of JavaScript frameworks, what pops into your mind? JQuery, KnockoutJS, or EmberJS? Did you know that Yahoo! has one of their own?&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">It's </span><a href="http://yuilibrary.com/" target="_blank" style="line-height: 1.6em;">YUI</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">and it's actually not too bad of a framework.&nbsp;</span></p><p>It's definitely not what you'd think of when creating a new web application. For any kind of DOM manipulation, I'm sure the first thought will be to use jQuery. I wouldn't exactly count out Yahoo!, though. They have some of the top engineers of the country and they released YUI as an <a href="https://github.com/yui/yui3" target="_blank">open project</a> for anyone to fork and contribute to.</p><p>Below is a very small example of using YUI. How easily can you read through it?&nbsp;</p>
</div>






















<iframe src="http://embed.plnkr.co/1BHCphu3zq7kscZeAAxV/script.js"  style="height: 250px; width: 100%;"></iframe>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Fairly simple, right?&nbsp; You get one instance of the element with the "btn1" ID and on the click event run the function that has the alert.</p><p>Let's look at a more complex example of YUI in action. We're going to make a JSONP call to the GitHub API. Let's take a look.</p>
</div>






















<iframe src="http://embed.plnkr.co/kutQoPXhTNxWo1Nv1khL/script.js"  style="height: 500px; width: 100%;"></iframe>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Not too much more here than in our first example. I'm still using the selector and click event handler as we've seen but in the click handler of the button I make a JSONP call to the GitHub API. The real magic happens during the function that handles the response from the JSONP call. The&nbsp;<em>Y.Lang.sub</em>&nbsp; call takes in an HTML template and uses the data from the response to bind the items in the brackets. Of course, the names have to match what you get back in the response.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>These are just very small examples of what you can do with YUI. The <a href="http://yuilibrary.com/" target="_blank">documentation</a>&nbsp;contains a ton more examples and functionality of what the framework is capable of.</p><p>I do believe this is easier to maintain and use than using jQuery. I do have to say, though, since I've found AngularJS, I believe I'll be using that more and more. If I couldn't use that, however, YUI would be my framework of choice.&nbsp;</p><p></p>

      <title>The Medium Experience</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/20/even-the-simplest-of-mistakes-happen</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"></span>This is a bit different than most posts here, but I've come to just love what <a href="https://medium.com/" target="_blank">Medium</a> does. If you haven't heard of it, it's basically a medium (pun intended, of course) in which anybody can come in and write articles about whatever they're passionate about or what inspires them. I've definitely found many great reads there. Since it seems like a great place to just get feedback I thought I'd give it a shot myself.</p><p>I've recently had a bit of an...embarrassing event happen in my career and I thought it would be a good story to share through Medium. So I hope you take a few minutes (seriously, Medium indicated that it's a two minute read) and maybe have a laugh at my expense and see that <a href="https://medium.com/what-i-learned-building/e2cc4ea78204" target="_blank">even the most professional of people can make trivial mistakes</a>.</p>

      <title>Book Review: Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/27/book-review-steve-jobs-by-walter-isaacson</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I'm sure I'm a bit late <a target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1501127624/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1501127624&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId=a0e2a8200dbb5b7a2ce74b879b3dd26e">reading this</a> and I'll admit I didn't know hardly a thing about Steve Jobs before coming into this book. The only reason I decided to give it a shot was that it was so well recommended by the tech community online, especially after the Ashton Kutcher <a target="_blank" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2357129/">movie</a>&nbsp;went out in theaters. "Why not?", I figured. "I like biographies and it'll give me some more background of the man himself as well as to how he ran Apple." So I went straight to my library to get a copy.</p><p> </p><p>It was definitely a great read. It felt more like a novel than just a biography which makes it an easy read and helps it get read that much faster. It still took a couple of weeks to get through it, though I believe I'm a bit of a slower reader than many as I think it helps understand more of what I'm reading.</p><p>The main things that became instantly interesting was how much of a visionary Steve Jobs apparently was at Apple as well as how much business sense he instantly had. True Steve Wozniak basically did the engineering for the Apple I and II. However, if it wasn't for Jobs then I doubt the company exist at all. Truly, his drive to create a company definitely came to fruition.</p><p> </p><p>There were many things the biography helped to learn about why certain events occurred, such as how and why he was ousted from Apple in the mid 80s, how Microsoft helped the company when he was brought back to Apple, how he was involved with Pixar, and the beginnings of what became the the iPod and iPhone. Interestingly, the way they came about is just the other products out there, as Jobs would say, sucked.</p><p>Steve Jobs' love of technology and design is a rare combination even in these days. How many developers do you know are actually good designers? I'm definitely not one of them (though, I am trying to learn)&nbsp;. I used to think that the closed ecosystem of Apple creating their own hardware, software, and services was a bad idea, but like Wozniak I'm beginning to understand how it helps the end user experience as a whole.</p><p>The biography even helped with a bit of understanding of the business culture as a whole since it repeatedly went to how meetings went with Jobs and the Apple board. Even as a CEO Jobs tended to be different than others by taking hours or days to make a decision on something instead of months to do research how the decision could affect the company. That tells you how passionate he was about his products and what his company could do for people.</p><p>If you haven't read it yet, I definitely recommend it. Of course, you can always just wait for the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/11/15/3650260/aaron-sorkin-steve-jobs-movie-three-30-minute-sections">movie</a>. I have high hopes it'll be better than the aforementioned one.</p><p>As for myself, I think I'll be test driving more Apple products in the future.</p>

      <title>Top People I Follow on Twitter</title>
      <link>/blog/2013/9/30/top-people-to-follow-on-twitter</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I love Twitter. I like how it's one of the best ways to share content and thoughts with everyone else. However, following too many people can put too much of a strain on you when checking for updates. I, like I'm sure many others do, have a few people I make sure to read each update I come across. Here's a list of those few I do my best to keep up with.</p><p>Note that when I say "people" on Twitter I also mean organizations as well as individuals.</p><p><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"></span></p><h3>Alexis Ohanian</h3><p></p><p>Alexis is probably most famous as being cofounder of reddit, but he's definitely doing some amazing work these days. From writing his own <a href="http://withouttheirpermission.com/" target="_blank">book</a> (you bet I got this the day it came out) to hosting an entrepreneurial show on The Verge - <a href="http://www.theverge.com/video/small-empires" target="_blank">Small Empires</a>, he's definitely one to follow and I'm always excited to see what he's up to next.</p><p>Twitter -&nbsp;<a class="pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/alexisohanian" style="line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="screen-name"><span>@</span>alexisohanian</span></a></p><h3>Inc Magazine</h3><p>If you're interested in bu<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">siness or leadership at all, this magazine and site has a lot of great articles that I've found useful. Their site practicing minimalism and very easy to navigate also helps.</span></p><p>Twitter -&nbsp;<a class="pretty-link js-nav" href="https://twitter.com/Inc" style="line-height: 1.6em;"><span class="screen-name"><span>@</span>Inc</span></a></p><h3>Kevin Rose</h3><p>If you're into technology at all, then this name should at least be familiar to you. Coming from the old (and awesome) days of TechTV via the show The Screen Savers, he's also the founder of <a href="http://digg.com/" target="_blank">Digg</a>&nbsp;and now currently works with <a href="http://www.googleventures.com/" target="_blank">Google Ventures</a> helping to find other awesome web start ups.&nbsp;</p><p>Twitter - &nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3;"><a href="https://twitter.com/kevinrose" target="_blank">@kevinrose</a></span></p><h3>Darya Rose</h3><p>Yep, the wife of Kevin Rose. She's fairly well known herself for starting a food blog - <a href="http://summertomato.com/" target="_blank">Summer Tomato</a> (whom I happen to have found from the person below) and from there her own book - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Foodist-Science-Weight-Without-Dieting/dp/0062201255" target="_blank">Foodist</a>. Darya is definitely one of the best I've come across in terms of breaking down the science of healthy food into a way that is easily understandable. If anyone I meet has questions on food I always point them to her.</p><p>Twitter -&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3;"><a href="https://twitter.com/summertomato" target="_blank">@summertomato</a></span></p><h3>Tim Ferriss</h3><p>Famous for his books - <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Workweek-Anywhere-Expanded/dp/0307465357" target="_blank">Four&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">Hour Workweek</span></a><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Body-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/030746363X" target="_blank">Four Hour Body</a>, and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Chef-Learning-Anything/dp/0547884591" target="_blank">Four Hour Chef</a>, I definitely consider Tim to be a modern day Renaissance Man. From starting his own nutritional company to becoming a tango and kickboxing champion, Tim has tons of experiences and he freely gives his advice away on his <a href="http://www.fourhourworkweek.com/blog/" target="_blank">blog</a>.</span></p><p>Twitter -&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3;"><a href="https://twitter.com/tferriss" target="_blank">@tferriss</a></span></p><h3>John Robbins</h3><p>This can't be a post on a develo<span style="line-height: 1.6em;">pment blog without a developer, could it? I consider John, cofounder of <a href="http://www.wintellect.com/" target="_blank">Wintellect</a>, to be one of the best when it comes to doing anything with .NET. This is the guy who got me interested in performance and debugging. When Microsoft has them come in to teach their developers, I make sure to listen on what they have to say.</span></p><p>Twitter -&nbsp;<span style="line-height: 1.3;"><a href="https://twitter.com/JohnWintellect" target="_blank">@JohnWintellect</a></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

      <title>Consuming the Jamendo API with AngularJS: Services</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/17/consuming-the-jamendo-api-with-angularjs-services</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>It took a little while to get back to this little project. After watching some nice stuff from <a target="_blank" href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2014/1/18/as-a-virtual-attendee-at-ng-conf">NgConf</a> the other week, it helped get me excited again for AngularJs. Plus, I was stuck on a problem for quite a while that I'll explain in more detail below that really slowed me down. After a bit of a break I got back to it and was able to figure it out.</p><h3>Services</h3><p>Before we looked at how to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/175">$http get method</a> from AngularJS, but all of that was within the Angular controller itself. To separate things out and to help us test easier I moved the $http calls into an Angular <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.angularjs.org/guide/dev_guide.services.creating_services">service</a>.</p><p>To recap, let's take a look at our controller currently:</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6956281.js?file=AlbumController.js"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>As mentioned earlier, we have our $http call right inside of our controller. While that definitely works, it's better to separate that out into it's own service. Let's refactor this down a bit...</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6956281.js?file=AlbumsController2.js"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Now this looks a bit cleaner. We're first passing in the <em>albumsService </em>as a dependency into the controller. Of course, if Angular can't find that the <em>albumsService </em>is defined, it'll throw an error.</p><p>Next, we have the function definition of our <em>getAlbums </em>method. In here we extract out the artist from the scope and then call the <em>getAlbums </em>method on our service. In our call to the service we give it a function as a callback if the $http get was a success that we'll see later when we look at our service. This basically just gets the results and puts them into the scope.</p><p>Now let's take a look at our service.</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6956281.js?file=albumsService.js"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Pretty straight forward as it's basically the same as what we had in our controller earlier. We inject in the $http Angular object and we create our <em>getAlbums</em> method while prepending it with <em>this</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>When we call our success promise from the <em>get</em> method, I just pass in the callback method that we defined in our controller earlier. This makes it a bit easier on our service since the callback method was updating our <em>$scope</em> object and we don't have to worry about that here in our service.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that I had a bit of an issue that kept me from finishing this up. I kept getting an <em>$inject</em> error on my service that indicated that it wasn't defined, but I couldn't figure out why that was. After some fiddling around with it, it turns out that I was trying to inject the <em>$scope</em> object into the service and Angular doesn't like that. That's also a reason to use the callback.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Moving the <em>$http</em> get call to an Angular service is mostly just a small refactoring, but it's a good one to do. We will see later when we start to do testing how much easier it is to have that separated out.</p><p>Of course, this was just an introduction to Angular services so there's tons more to learn about them. I'll recommend <a target="_blank" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/dwahlin/">Dan Wahlin's</a> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM">AngularJS in 60ish Minutes</a> to anyone. In fact, I've referenced it a few times to remind myself about services. There's also the WintellectNow video from <a target="_blank" href="http://csharperimage.jeremylikness.com/">Jeremy Likness </a>on <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wintellectnow.com/Videos/Watch/angularjs-services">AngularJS Services</a>&nbsp;that goes into much greater detail of services.</p><p>You can play with the <a target="_blank" href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jwood803/JamendoAngular/blob/master/index.html">demo </a>and, as always, you can play around with the <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/jwood803/JamendoAngular">code </a>itself.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>This past Thursday and Friday, Google held a public conference for all things AngularJS. I'm sure you've noticed lately that I've been a bit of a fan of it, especially the more I play around with what it all has to offer.&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, the fine folks who put on the conference decided to stream it as it was going on. Awesome! I got to catch a few of the sessions. Though, it's not the same as actually attending as I couldn't meet all the great people and speakers there, watching the live stream is the next best thing.</p><p>I didn't get to see all of the sessions yet (they have all been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ngconfvideos">uploaded</a>), but here are the ones I have seen that seemed to stand out:</p><ul><li>Before any of the sessions, the two keynotes are a must watch first<ul><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1A1VR0ibIQ">Miško Hevery and Brad Green</a>&nbsp; - The past and future of AngularJS</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-SQvre_6qU">Igor Minar</a> - The AngularJS community</li></ul></li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnXO-i7944M">AngularJS in 20ish Minutes</a>&nbsp;- Dan Wahlin's <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i9MHigUZKEM">AngularJS in 60ish Minutes</a> video is what got me started in AngularJS.</li><li><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4FJ_kuO9Rc">Filters Beyond OrderBy and LimitTo</a>&nbsp;- Interesting look at AngularJS filters.

      <title>First Wintellect Blog Post + A New Series On Design Patterns</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Just recently, I published my first blog post to the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wintellect.com/">Wintellect</a>&nbsp;(my awesome new employer) site. May not seem like much, but it's pretty exciting for me.</p><p>One of the things to keep yourself learning, I feel, is to tackle the stuff you feel you understand the least. For me, one of those things was the concept and implementation of different design patterns. I'm probably already too late in the game for this, but better than not learning it at all, right?</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.wintellect.com/blogs/jwood/head-first-design-patterns---part-1-observer-pattern">Head First Design Patterns - Part 1: Observer Pattern</a></p>

      <title>Beginning Ruby for C# Developers</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/1/3/beginning-ruby-for-c-developers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Ruby has become quite popular as a programming language over the past few years. Probably mainly due to the popularity of the <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Ruby on Rails</a> framework. Because of its popularity, it makes sense to learn at least the basics of it and what all it can do for you as a developer.</p>
</div>






















<p class="note">Until I have a better solution for embedding Ruby code and output, I'm just embedding the code and results as Github Markdown for now. Even though it doesn't seem to display properly in the embed, it does when viewing the actual gist on GitHub.</p>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2><p>One of the easiest ways to get started using Ruby is to just use your browser. <a target="_blank" href="http://repl.it/languages/Ruby">Repl.it</a> is a site that supports many dynamic languages to be run in a browser and it's very handy to just play around in.</p><p>I've also seen people use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text</a> to edit their Ruby code (I admit, I enjoy using it as well as a light weight IDE. I've had no problems using the beta of version 3, either). For Windows, you'd just need to <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">install</a> Ruby. If you're on a Mac, you already have it installed. In fact, you can just type "ruby -v" in the terminal to see what version you have.</p><p>Since Ruby is a dynamic language, there is no compiling. However, everything in Ruby is considered an object, and because of that everything will include some built in functions with it. With everything in Ruby being an object isn't necessarily a new concept to C# developers since every object in C# derives from System.Object and you do get a few predefined functions, Ruby just seems to have gone that extra step.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, say you want to run a statement three times in a row. How would you do that in Ruby? It's actually easier than just using a for-loop similar to what you would do in C# or even creating a way to use a lambda expression.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/8290160.js?file=times.md"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Pretty easy and very straight forward, especially for someone who may not even have a programming background.</p><p>Let's go on with a few other basics...</p><h3>Output</h3><p>Ruby has a couple of ways to display output back to the console. The main way is to use the "print" statement, though you may also see the "puts" (put string) command as well. The only difference in these is the "puts" command will append a new line. You'll probably see these statements quite a bit, especially if you go through online tutorials.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/8290160.js?file=output.md"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h3><span style="font-size:13px">Methods</span></h3><p>As mentioned earlier everything in Ruby is an object, and since that's true it can have methods on those objects. Of course, depending on the type Ruby recognizes it during runtime is what methods are available. For example, the "length" method can be used on strings but not on numbers.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/8290160.js?file=length.md"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Methods, like in C#, can also be chained together to give some added syntactic sugar and to reduce the overall code needed to accomplish what you need.</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/8290160.js?file=chaining.md"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>One final note about methods that got me confused early on but I thought was really nice is that there is a bit of a naming convention associated with certain methods. Mainly methods that change the object itself and methods that return a boolean.</p><p>Take the "<a target="_blank" href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-upcase-21">upcase</a>" method we used earlier. There are actually two versions of this method, "upcase" and "upcase!". The first returns a <em>copy</em> of the string being used, the second (indicated with an exclamation point) changes the instance of the string being used. In other words, the first version causes the string to be immutable.</p><p>For methods that return a boolean value a question mark is appended to the end of the method name to indicate to the developer that that method can be used for branching. Take the string's "<a target="_blank" href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.0/String.html#method-i-empty-3F">empty?</a>" method, for example. As you can probably tell, it returns if the string is empty or not.</p><h3>Program Flow</h3><p>Like most programming languages Ruby supports the if/else block. However, one noticeable difference is that Ruby also has an "<a target="_blank" href="http://ruby-doc.org/docs/keywords/1.9/Object.html#method-i-unless">unless</a>"' keyword. It will only execute if the given conditional is false. This was included to help make certain branching more readable and a bit more intuitive.</p><p>So we can change the structure of an if/else to an unless block like so...</p>
</div>






















<script src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/8290160.js?file=unless.md"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2>Further Learning</h2><p>One of the best resources I can recommend to help get you on the path of learning Ruby much easier is <a target="_blank" href="http://www.codewars.com/">Code Wars</a>. This site has quite a few code <a target="_blank" href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2013/8/28/code-katas-can-be-fun">katas</a> that will help in understanding the syntax and included methods that come in with Ruby.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> is recommended a lot, as well, by people and for very good reason...they have a lot of good interactive tutorials for learning Ruby.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Of course, I definitely don't know everything about the language or all the tools the community uses. I still haven't gotten my head totally around gem files or rake. I'm not even totally sure of the correct structure of a Ruby application! But, hopefully this will at least spark some interest in you C# people to maybe try something different outside of the .NET world. There is plenty of fun to be had with it and I throughly enjoy learning the language and all it has to offer.</p>

      <title>Xamarin Evolve - Recap</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/11/xamarin-evolve-recap</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I wanted to get a day two recap out Thursday night like I did the day before with <a href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2014/10/8/xamarin-evolve-day-1-summary">day one</a> but, and I'll be honest with you, day two was just so much fun and action packed that as soon as I got back to the room I went straight to bed to try to get enough rest for the final day. So in this post, I'll go over day two and the final day of the conference.</p>

<h3 id="daytwo">Day Two</h3>

<p>Day two of the conference was all about the sessions. Here are a few of the ones I attended.</p>

<h5 id="sketches">Sketches</h5>

<p>This was one of the secret sessions they had listed on the schedule and I'm glad I went to it to find out more. Mostly this was just an expansion of what they shown in the keynote but with a bit more of an elaborate demo. The cool thing, for me, is that Sketches will support F# as well soon. That'll be good for just having a sandbox to learn more about the language.</p>

<h5 id="xamarinstudio">Xamarin Studio</h5>

<p>One of the more interesting sessions was this one on how to master Xamarin Studio itself. What impressed me most about Xamarin Studio was that there is a setting in the preferences (<code>Text Editor</code> -> <code>Source Analysis</code>) that has a very similar analysis that ReSharper has for Visual Studio...and before Visual Studio even incorporated it!</p>

<h5 id="crossplatformappsinf">Cross-platform Apps in F</h5>

<p>I admit, one of the main reasons I wanted to come to Xamarin Evolve was to go to these F# sessions and they certainly didn't disappoint. This was the first one where <a href="http://rachelree.se/">Rachel Reese</a> gave her talk on running iOS and Android apps using F# with a bit of a nice F# introduction mainly concerning with why we would want to use it.</p>

<h3 id="closing">Closing</h3>

<p>The final day was just a few more sessions in the morning then the closing announcements.</p>

<h5 id="awesomeappsinf">Awesome Apps in F</h5>

<p>This fun talk was mainly with why use F# (or basically any functional language) and showed how much more concise and readable refactoring from an object oriented way to a functional way can be.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>The best way to describe this experience was that it was nothing short of amazing! Big thanks to Xamarin and all of their employees for making this happen and being awesome! I really look forward to next year and I've gotten the thought in my head to even try to present at the next one. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introduction to Paket</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/22/introduction-to-paket</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/">Paket</a> has been quite the talk lately in the .NET community, and for very good reason. It is essentially another way to manage dependencies in your .NET projects.</p>

<h4 id="butwhyreplacenuget">But why replace NuGet?</h4>

<p>Paket is basically a NuGet replacement so I'm sure you're wondering, "<a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/faq.html#I-don-t-understand-why-I-need-Paket-to-manage-my-packages-Why-can-t-I-just-use-NuGet">why would we need to replace NuGet?</a>" Paket essentially just takes the functionality of NuGet and adds some extra nice features.</p>

<p>For one thing, Paket makes it able for you to control exactly what's happening with your package dependencies. No more conflict between different packages if those packages reference different versions of the same dependent package.</p>

<p>Another really cool thing Paket does is that it can reference a <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/github-dependencies.html">single file from GitHub</a>. How many times have you needed that and just wound up downloading what you needed and using it that way? If a new version of that file comes along, you'll have to repeat that process.</p>

<h4 id="butimalreadyusingnuget">But I'm already using NuGet</h4>

<p>No problem at all! Paket has a nifty <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/convert-from-nuget.html"><code>convert-from-nuget</code></a> command to get you up and going.</p>

<h4 id="imhookedbuthowdoigetstarted">I'm hooked...but how do I get started?</h4>

<p>First, you need to include a <a href="https://github.com/jwood803/Demos/tree/master/Demos/PaketDemo/.paket"><code>.paket</code></a> folder in the root of your solution. This will include <code>paket.exe</code> that will be used to install and restore packages.</p>

<p>Once that folder and its contents are there, you'll need to create a <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/dependencies-file.html"><code>paket.dependencies</code></a> file in the root directory of your solution. This file will be similar to the following:</p>

<p><code>
source http://nuget.org/api/v2 <br />
nuget FSharp.Data <br />
nuget FAKE
</code></p>

<p>This file tells Paket what the sources are (NuGet or GitHub) and the package/file names so it can be downloaded.</p>

<p>You can then use a <a href="https://github.com/jwood803/Demos/blob/master/Demos/PaketDemo/build.cmd"><code>build.cmd</code></a> file or manually call <code>paket.exe</code> like below. </p>

<p><code>
\.paket\paket.exe install
</code></p>

<p>This will create a <code>packages</code> folder that will include all the libraries.</p>

<p>From here you can always manually reference the libraries that you want, but Paket makes this easy as well. In each of the folders where you have a project file, create a <a href="http://fsprojects.github.io/Paket/references-files.html"><code>paket.references</code></a> file that contain the names of each library you want to be referenced, like below.</p>

<p><code>
FSharp.Data
</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that <code>FAKE</code> isn't in the file since it won't get referenced. The <code>paket.references</code> file will only add to the project if the library is in a <code>lib</code> folder. <code>FAKE</code> is in a <code>tools</code> folder. This isn't a problem since it can be referenced manually in the <code>build.fsx</code> file.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To get Paket to use the references file, simply rerun the install command with the <code>--hard</code> switch.</p>

<p><code>
\.paket\paket.exe install --hard
</code></p>

<p>This will look at the <code>paket.references</code> file and use that to automatically reference the project with the appropriate libraries.</p>

<p>After that, you're good to get started on your project.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>Hopefully this walkthrough will help you get started with using Paket to make your package management easier than before. This is still a young and very active project so I wouldn't be surprised if there are tons of things that this can do for all of our .NET projects.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Xamarin Evolve - Day 1 Summary</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/10/8/xamarin-evolve-day-1-summary</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Considering this is my first time going to an actual conference, especially one at this size, I believe I could be easily impressed by anything done at <a href="https://evolve.xamarin.com/">Xamarin Evolve</a>. And indeed, I was impressed! From all the the quality of the presentations to just how well this event is being run, this is definitely an event I'll remember and will want to come back to next year.</p>

<p>I admit, I haven't done much with Xamarin and their tools other than getting excited over this conference and some small playing around with <a href="https://xamarin.com/studio">Xamarin Studio</a>. After this first day, though, I'm excited to play around with it a lot more and utilize it for mobile apps.</p>

<h3 id="keynote">Keynote</h3>

<p>Things started off with the co-founders on stage giving a keynote that contained quite a few surprises.</p>

<h4 id="profiler">Profiler</h4>

<p>First thing announced was a <a href="http://xamarin.com/profiler">profiler</a> for Android and iOS apps to help developers dig deeper into performance issues. This is apparently helpful since there isn't really an alternate solution for profiling mobile apps. Especially one as nice as they have made.</p>

<h4 id="mobileuitests">Mobile UI Tests</h4>

<p>This one really got me excited the more I saw demos of it in use. The Xamarin team has created a library to create unit tests that can launch the app and perform actions within the app. If certain items on the screen can't be found or an action can't be performed, it will fail the test.</p>

<p>Now this by itself can be useful for an integration test suite, but what's really exciting is this is integrated into the <a href="http://xamarin.com/test-cloud">Xamarin Test Cloud</a> so the tests can be run on all devices that it needs to be run on! </p>

<h4 id="androidplayer">Android Player</h4>

<p>I'm sure that if you ask any Android developer what the biggest pain point is in developing an Android app is that the emulator take a really long time to start up when debugging/running an application. Really...you can probably go on a 30 minute walk and it <em>may</em> be finished loading the OS and start your app.</p>

<p>What Xamarin has done was to create a way better experience for this. During the demos the <a href="http://xamarin.com/android-player">Android Player</a> took way over half the time to launch, start the OS, and launch the app than with the emulator. This by itself definitely got most people excited.</p>

<h4 id="sketches">Sketches</h4>

<p>Another interesting thing they announced is <a href="http://developer.xamarin.com/guides/cross-platform/sketches/">Sketches</a> which is a live coding environment that executes the code as you type. The interesting thing with this, though, is that they've integrated an analysis pane. Xamarin has allowed graphing within Sketches. If prototyping a small UI, you can even use Android or iOS components right within Sketches.</p>

<h4 id="xamarininsights">Xamarin Insights</h4>

<p>Xamarin also announced a way to monitor apps when they have been published and out for the public to use.</p>

<p><a href="http://xamarin.com/insights">Xamarin Insights</a> looks like it has a lot to offer than the other services that do this. Just by adding only a few lines of code in your app you can get real time notifications of errors that includes stack traces and even show how users will interact with your app.</p>

<p>This and the UI tests together will make a world of a difference in the quality of your mobile apps.</p>

<h3 id="dayoneconclusion">Day One Conclusion</h3>

<p>Just after day one I'm glad I decided to come to this conference. I've already learned a ton and got back some excitement from coding that I used to have. I can't wait for what's in store for day two.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My First Speaking Engagement is Official</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/3/23/my-first-speaking-engagement-is-official</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I've often thought about being the one in front of the room during a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_Camp">code camp</a> or some other speaking event. Though, like most of us, I've always been reluctant to put myself up there, scared that someone will call me out on not knowing what I was talking about or, worse yet, they all walk out on me.</p><p>However, with the fine coworkers at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wintellect.com/">Wintellect</a> and other friends, I decided to bite the bullet and sign up as a speaker for the <a target="_blank" href="http://codecamp.developersguild.org/">Carolina Code Camp</a> this year. After a couple of days of debating with myself on what to talk about, I decided that a talk on the JavaScript garbage collector would be interesting. I've always enjoyed learning about performance and this should be practical for others to learn as well.</p><p>So if you're near the Charlotte, NC area on Saturday, May 3, I encourage you to attend what has always been a great event since I've been going three years ago. Hope to see you there! If you end up going and even go to my session, try to refrain from throwing things.</p><p><a target="_blank" href="http://codecamp.developersguild.org/sessions/2014/3/15/the-javascript-garbage-collector-demystified">The JavaScript Garbage Collector Demystified</a></p>

      <title>Why F# for the Enterprise</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/12/why-should-you-try-f</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>I have gotten bit by the F# bug lately. After helping to release the <a target="_blank" href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2014/6/9/exercism-f-track-now-available">F# portion of Exercism</a>&nbsp;I've started to enjoy more and more of what F# has to offer. Of course, F# is a sort of "hybrid" language where you&nbsp;<em>can</em>&nbsp;do object oriented and procedural programming if you make it that way, but out of the box it's trying to get you to go more functional.</p><p>Several folks have <a target="_blank" href="http://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/why-f-by-f-weekly/">posted </a>as to why learn F# in the first place, but I figured I'd give some reasons why I think F# would be great for scenarios inside enterprise applications. While a few what others have mentioned as good reasons to learn F# in the first place, I believe these would also be the top reasons for enterprise development.</p><h3>What's wrong with the current enterprise solutions?</h3><p>Well, nothing, really. Of course, just because one solution works doesn't mean it's the most productive or easiest to maintain. For example, CSS precompilers like SASS and LESS do this with plain CSS stylesheets.</p><p>Why not use something that makes our lives, as developers, easier and helps to bring back the fun in developing again?</p><h2>No More NullReferenceExceptions</h2>
</div>






















<blockquote data-preserve-html-node="true" class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" lang="en"><p data-preserve-html-node="true">&gt; <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/davetchepak">@davetchepak</a> &quot;What can C# do that F# cannot?&quot; NullReferenceException :-)</p>&mdash; Tomas Petricek (@tomaspetricek) <a data-preserve-html-node="true" href="https://twitter.com/tomaspetricek/statuses/314872258839601152">March 21, 2013</a></blockquote>

<script data-preserve-html-node="true" async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>While the above always tends to make me laugh,&nbsp;I'm quite sure each and every developer has fixed a production defect that involved this error.&nbsp;</p><p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1403224914705_27561">In F# there are is no thought of "null". You'll even get a compiler error if you try to use "null" in a pure F# program. For example, take a peek at the below code:</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6091c0ef9d85503a9d27.js?file=FSharpRecordType.fs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>We're just defining some record types - Person and Employee - and let binding the Employee record with some values. Now, what happens if I set Person to null?</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6091c0ef9d85503a9d27.js?file=FSharpRecordTypeNullReference.fs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>The compiler won't even let us try that...</p>
</div>

























  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1403310570555-OEY4ZOWZIM0XPKS6P3TM/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=" Trying to assign null to a record type. "/>  Trying to assign null to a record type. [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>So this shows that, in pure F# code, the compiler won't allow us to set records as null which greatly reduces, perhaps even eliminates, NullReferenceExceptions.</p><h3>What if we still need null?</h3><p>There are some exceptions where F# will allow you to use null. Both of which involve using the .NET libraries.</p><ul><li>As a parameter when calling one of the .NET libraries.</li><li>Handling if a call to a .NET library returns null.</li></ul><p>Even using null in these scenarios can greatly reduce the NullReferenceException occurring in your application. To me, that's just one less thing I need to worry about.</p><h3>But I still need it in my F# code</h3><p>No worries! The language has you covered on that aspect as well. Allow me to introduce the <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233245.aspx">option type</a>. This is used if a value might not exist.</p><p>Let's take a small example of a bank account.</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6091c0ef9d85503a9d27.js?file=FSharpBankAccount.fs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>If the account isn't open yet or has already been closed, we don't expect a value. Otherwise, we do expect some value.</p><h3>None vs null</h3><p dir="ltr">How is this different than assigning to null? Remember that None is an option <em>type.&nbsp;</em>Because of that, the compiler will help us out if we may have missed anything. For example, in F# you can do <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd547125.aspx">pattern matching</a>. Let's see how we can use pattern matching with the option type.</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6091c0ef9d85503a9d27.js?file=FSharpPatternMatchingOptions.fs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Good to go there. But, what if we happened to miss a match on None? We'll get this warning:</p>
</div>

























  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1554"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1403372849471-L8WTM0WNKMKXQC6XD7HO/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" Pattern match warning. "/>  Pattern match warning. [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  

<h2 id="yui_3_17_2_1_1403364131623_18963">Units of Measure</h2>
</div>























<p><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233243.aspx">Units of Measure</a> allow you to explicitly type a certain unit. F# does have predefined unit names and unit symbols in the <code>Microsoft.FSharp.Data.UnitSystems.SI.UnitNames</code> and <code>Microsoft.FSharp.Data.UnitSystems.SI.UnitSymbols</code> namespaces.</p>

<p>For example, say we wanted to use meters. Instead of assuming our application is using meters throughout all the calculation, which has a probability of being converted to another unit but still being represented as meter, we would just need to do the following:</p>
<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6091c0ef9d85503a9d27.js?file=FSharpUnitOfMeasure.fs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Microsoft has <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh289721.aspx">included a few units of measure</a> for us, as mentioned earlier, but we can definitely create our own. Say we had an application that dealt with different types of world currencies. We can easily define them as units of measure.</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6091c0ef9d85503a9d27.js?file=FSharpCustomUnitOfMeasure.fs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>Now, what does this do for us exactly? Let's try to convert how many euros are in a dollar amount.</p>
</div>






















<script data-preserve-html-node="true" src="https://gist.github.com/jwood803/6091c0ef9d85503a9d27.js?file=FSharpUnitOfMeasureError.fs"></script>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p>The first method we defined works just fine since we're using the units of measure. However, the second method generates a compile error since it can't infer what type "0.74" should be.</p><p>Since a unit of measure is typed, it will generate compile errors and reduce the amount of defects your application can cause due to a mismatch of units. This type of error <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Climate_Orbiter#Cause_of_failure">does happen</a>&nbsp;in real world applications...even to NASA engineers.</p><h2>Type Providers</h2><p><a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh156509.aspx">Type providers</a> in F# is essentially a way to access all sorts of data. There are <a target="_blank" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/dsyme/archive/2013/01/30/twelve-type-providers-in-pictures.aspx">quite a few of them </a>all ready for you to use now.</p><p>Just the SQL type providers alone are worth it for enterprise applications. Even better, you can even use them to access&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh361035.aspx">Entity Framework</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh361039.aspx">LINQ to SQL</a>.</p><p>Another important one that may be of great use to enterprise applications is the <a target="_blank" href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/JsonProvider.html">JSON type provider</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Type providers provide an easy way to consume data within F# and, if you'd like, use C# to handle that data.</p>
</div>
























<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p id="yui_3_17_2_1_1403373854106_15937">The above are just a few reasons of why I believe F# to be of great use to developing enterprise applications. Using the above, the risks of error would be greatly reduced and productivity would be increased. I know I'll be doing more F# in my applications from now on and I can only see it getting even better in the future as this language evolves.</p>

      <title>Exercism F# Track Now Available</title>
      <link>/blog/2014/6/9/exercism-f-track-now-available</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2>Wait....F#?</h2><p>Yep. After attending an interesting talk by <a target="_blank" href="http://jamessdixon.wordpress.com/">James Dixon</a> on data in F# I got a bit interested in the language. Of course, that's followed by reading articles, watching videos, and playing with it a bit on my own. The past month or so I've been messing around with it and plan on sticking to it for a while.</p><p>I can see F# going places in terms of functional programming and it's uses within .NET. Be prepared for more F# posts in the future, as well.</p><h2>What is Exercism?</h2><p>In short, <a target="_blank" href="http://exercism.io/">Exercism</a>&nbsp;is another site where people can learn a new programming language by doing different exercises. The difference with this one than the others, however, is that it's crowd-sourced. Meaning that, once you finish an exercise, you can send it off to be code reviewed by others.</p><p>It's definitely the best of both worlds where you practice the language and get peer reviews to help you learn that much quicker.</p><h2>F# Track</h2><p>And so, since I got interested &nbsp;a bit more in F# and no one started messing with it in the Exercism F#&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/exercism/xfsharp">repository</a>, I figured I'd give it a shot. After a little while I was able to get it to meet the requirements to be launched!</p><p>Hopefully, I did decently in my own examples for the exercises (and if not, I'm not scared of some helpful tips), and that some people can get a bit of use out of it.</p><p>So feel free to give it a <a target="_blank" href="http://exercism.io/getting-started">try </a>and let me know or submit an <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/exercism/xfsharp/issues">issue </a>if there are any problems!</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2013/9/20/even-the-simplest-of-mistakes-happen">Once again</a> I've been playing around (and definitely reading) with <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>. Honestly, this is probably one of the best mediums for writing, especially how much tied it is to Twitter and Facebook for very easy sharing. I figured I'd write a few articles there to share around that community.</p>

<ul>

      <title>Book Review: Elon Musk Biography</title>
      <link>/blog/2015/8/14/pk3qc5i78pj4n28hdhvbgihff2pa45</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've done a few <a href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/?category=Book+Review">book reviews</a> in the past here, but I admit I've been slacking a bit. Not on the reading, though. I've actually been reading even more. I've been slacking <em>a lot</em> in writing about my thoughts and notes on each of the books. It's time to change that.</p>
<p><a data-preserve-html-node="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062301233/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062301233&amp;linkCode={{linkCode}}&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId={{link_id}}"><img data-preserve-html-node="true" border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&amp;MarketPlace=US&amp;ASIN=0062301233&amp;ServiceVersion=20070822&amp;ID=AsinImage&amp;WS=1&amp;Format=_SL250_&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20"></a><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0062301233" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;"></p>
<p>For those who are a bit out of the loop and doesn't know who <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk">Elon Musk</a> is, he's the CEO of both <a href="http://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a> and <a href="http://www.teslamotors.com/">Tesla</a> as well as a chairman of <a href="http://www.solarcity.com/">SolarCity</a>. From those credentials alone you can definitely tell that this guy knows what he's doing! One thing I like to tell people when describing Elon Musk is that I do believe he's the biggest innovator of our generation. This book, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062301233/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0062301233&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId=0e562aff9295ff49b645e2671b33a646">Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future</a><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0062301233" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">, will definitely describe how that statement is true.</p><p>From the start you get a sense of Elon as he was as a young kid. The biggest thing to hit me was just how much he read at a young age. This is actually not very surprising as I've always heard that the best leaders and innovators are voracious readers. Of course, that's not the reason I like to read, but it is nice to know that you share this habit with people like Elon.</p><p>What is interesting is the story of Elon's earlier companies, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/zip2">Zip2</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk#X.com_and_PayPal">X.Com</a>. X.Com eventually did merge with PayPal and Elon was the largest shareholder in the company. These two companies gave Elon his first millions.</p><h3 id="spacex">SpaceX</h3><p>With the money from the previous companies, Elon started SpaceX. This was brought on by a life-long dream to go to Mars. The book details the innovations and early failures of the company that builds their own rockets right in the US.</p><p>The innovations being that all parts of the rocket were built in-house at the SpaceX factory which turns out to be much cheaper than buying them from other countries. They continue to innovate by building rockets that can be <a href="http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/03/31/reusability-key-making-human-life-multi-planetary">reused by coming back to earth and land by themselves</a>.</p><p>They did have early failures when they tried to launch the first version of their Falcon rocket which almost brought the company into bankruptcy. Thankfully, they were able to get a successful launch and able to win a lot of bids from NASA to keep the company going.</p><h3 id="tesla">Tesla</h3><p>Tesla is definitely a company I've been following for a while. Ever since I got to test drive a Model S in Houston a year ago, I've been interested in them.</p><p>A bit of a detail of Elon and Tesla is that he's a co-founder because he was the first investor into the company. If he didn't do this, then the company would have gone bankrupt long ago and due to that, I would consider him a co-founder. With that said, Elon probably did do a lot for the company as its CEO. He helped get the initial <a href="">Roadster</a> out and had a lot of input into the Model S.</p><p>I'm definitely looking forward to what this company will bring, especially with them making their gigafactory that should help bring down the cost of the batteries and, overall, the cost of the car.</p><h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3><p>Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this biography. I already thought Elon Musk is an interesting person and definitely someone I'd want to meet one day. This book gave a bit more insight into him as a CEO and innovator as well as the histories of SpaceX and Tesla.</p><p>I'm pretty sure there will be more to come from Elon and I'll be waiting anxiously for another book on the rest of Elon's innovative career.</p>

      <title>Using GIFs on Bug Reports</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/11/14/using-gifs-on-bug-reports</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've been developing software for any length of time you've fixed a bug or two that someone has reported. Whether for a customer or a user within your organization, sometime's words of how something is fixed or how to duplicate an issue may not be enough.</p>
<p>Using screenshots is great to show if something is working, especially if it is something easily to show like a UI element working. However, to show that a series of steps is working with the end showing that the fix is there, I believe GIFs are a great way to include in your bug reports after a fix has been implemented.</p>
<h3 id="but-how-do-i-make-a-gif-">But How Do I Make A GIF?</h3>
<p>I primarily run a Mac, so I really love how easy <a href="https://store.telestream.net/affiliate.php?ACCOUNT=TELESTRE&amp;AFFILIATE=90688&amp;PATH=http://www.telestream.net/screenflow/">Screenflow</a> is for this. Sure it's primarily for screencasting, and I use it <a href="http://devcenter.wintellect.com/jwood/using-xaml-f-xamarin-forms-screencast">for that, too</a>, but it's really easy to make GIFs with this.</p>
<p>Of course, there are free alternatives (before Screenflow I was using <a href="http://recordit.co/">Recordit</a> with good results) and they all are good to use in their own right. One thing I really like with Screenflow is that it is really easy to edit after recording your GIF.</p>
<h3 id="why-does-editing-gifs-matter-">Why Does Editing GIFs Matter?</h3>
<p>The primary reason why I'd want to edit a GIF is to remove unneeded parts of what I was recording. The same thing you'd do with any video, remove any dead or time consuming parts. If you're recording a GIF to show that something is working after a fix is put in, you may have times where you're waiting for a process to execute in order to show the fix is working. Editing your GIF to remove the time it takes for the process to launch and load will reduce the length of the GIF as well as to make it smaller for uploading or viewing.</p>
<p>Another awesome reason I like using Screenflow for GIFs is that you can use all the advanced screencasting features Screenflow provides for you inside of your GIFs. For instance, I can zoom in on places I want to show in the GIF or highlight specific areas of the screen so the viewer can know what I want them to see.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example. I did a very quick recording of some F# using VS Code and running a selection in the FSI. Here's the GIF of that using Screenflow's editing tools.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1479474094723-F01S5REUK8261Y91PMLJ/image-asset.gif?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Not the best edited example, but I hope it helps illustrate some of the things Screenflow can do to make GIFs that much better to include in bug reports.</p>
<p>There are a couple of things of note, though.</p>
<ul>
<li>Screenflow allowed me to specifiy what area I wanted to be recorded. I just adjusted the preview window right before recording to the size I needed.</li>
<li>I did a small zoom to better show the FSI output.</li>
<li>I did a callout to show to viewers the specific output in FSI of the input I gave it.</li>
</ul>
<p>I got Screenflow to start doing some screencasting, but since they've introduced GIF support I've been using it much more for caputuring GIFs for projects at work and uploading them to whatever bug tracker we're using (Jira, Visual Studio Team Services, GitHub) and, to me, it's been quite helpful. Often I've recorded a GIF and found something else I needed to work on for that issue before it should have been sent back as fixed.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Using Draw.IO for Mockups</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/11/4/using-drawio-for-mockups</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm definitely not a designer. However, there are times a developer has to do their best to get a new website out for a client and that means doing the initial design for it.</p>
<p>As I was thinking through this I figured doing wireframe mockups would be best. But what tool to use for it? There are some tools for this, of course. Since I didn't need anything real fancy I decided to give <a href="https://www.draw.io/">Draw.io</a> a try. Believe it or not, you can do some pretty decent wireframes with it. Here's a quick way to get started with it.</p>
<h2 id="enabling-mockups">Enabling Mockups</h2>
<p>You could use Draw.io's default shapes to create mockups, but they do include a lot of very helpful shapes and elements as well. These aren't on by default, however, so they must be enabled in order to use them.</p>
<p>First go to the <code>More Shapes</code> section below the elements section.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1478274739302-LBKLWB2I1VVX92ICVDQ4/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>In this popup you can then select to add the <code>Markup</code> section.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1478274999367-8TTZ0HSS5P4FW5JW948X/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="using-mockups">Using Mockups</h2>
<p>After the mockups are enabled, we can begin using them. I'll create a simple web page in this post to demonstrate a few items that may be helpful.</p>
<p>One of the mockup sections is the <code>Mockup Containers</code>. This has a mockup of a web page that we will use. Either drag and drop it to the canvas or single click on it to add it.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1478275626219-A9IC51FPTSSZFP00967S/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Within here we can create our page elements. How about we add a nav bar to the top?</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1478275933177-48V1LFR67EBNCNWMQTYF/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Here we did a drag and drop on the <code>Menu bar</code> element inside the <code>Mockup Forms</code> section. It comes with default text values but they can be changed by double-clicking inside of each of the single section elements to change the text.</p>
<p>Next we'll just add a simple <code>Welcome</code> text to the middle of the page. Draw.io is really good at giving you feedback on where you're positioning your elements. Here's a GIF to help illustrate.</p>

<p>The examples above are only just a small couple of things you can do with Draw.io. It is very good at quickly getting something going with simple mockups. While it's not a replacement for tools such as <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> it serves as a good tool to get ideas out for others to see in a visual way.</p>
<p>It was my first try at doing mockups and a design for a website. While designing the site wasn't as hard as I thought it would be I would need a lot of practice to imagine something really creative. The design I did was for a simple administration application that only a few people will be using. I may eventually step into the world of Sketch and learn how to use it for future mockups and wireframes. If you're like me an very new to this world, Draw.io is a good alternative to get something going quick, easy, and free.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Are Daily Status Meetings Still Needed?</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/11/7/are-daily-status-meetings-still-needed</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm sure you're used to this scenario in your career by now: you start a new project and the manager instantly schedules daily standup meetings for everyone on the project to give their status. However, how many times has that meeting gone longer than the supposed no longer than 15 minutes? How many times has the discussion gone very off-topic taking even more of everyone's time? Quite a few times I'm sure.</p>
<p>I'm going to propose right now that I believe these <strong>mandatory daily meeting slots are no longer required for developing software using Agile</strong>.</p>
<p>It has long been said that meetings are usually a waste of everyone's time that has to be in them. If you look at the <a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/">origins</a> of these daily meetings, you will note that it was first brought up in the late 80s and into the 90s. It was then further developed in the early 2000s. At that point I can understand the use of them. Everybody was in the same office and there weren't any tools at that time that they can use to reduce or eliminate thier time in these meetings.</p>
<p>A lot of my thoughts in this post are going to resonate with a post Zach Holman did a long while ago about <a href="https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/">asynchronous communication</a>. A good reason to use this type of communication is that people aren't commiting a specific block of their time. They can be in the best state of their entire career for programming thoughts to flow, but then they get a notification from their calendar that they have a status meeting in 15 minutes. This will definitely take them out of their flow state, take a few minutes to figure out what they need/want to say in the status meeting, then go to it.</p>
<p>From my experience these meetings always last longer than their intented length. It <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stand-up_meeting">is said</a> that they should only take 5 to 15 minutes total, but of course they usually go longer than that. And they usually go longer due to random, off-topic discussions. Whether it's about something with the project that came up and can be totally done over email or something about what the local college football team did the night before.</p>
<p>If the team is entirely remote then things get a bit more complicated. I agree with most things Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson suggest in their book, <a data-preserve-html-node="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0804137501/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0804137501&amp;linkCode={{linkCode}}&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId={{link_id}}">Remote: Office Not Required</a><img data-preserve-html-node="true" src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;l=am2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0804137501" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;">. Being remote should allow the employee the freedom to handle things at home at the time it happens. One example was that if you need to get groceries at 10am then you should be allowed to do that. Then you come back home and continue to work. Personally, if I need to take someone I care about to the doctor at that exact time, I shouldn't have to worry about whether or not I need to make it to a status meeting.</p>
<h3 id="communication-tools">Communication Tools</h3>
<p>I explained the reasons why it isn't the best reason to continue holding daily status meetings, but what can be done as an alternative? Communication tools are getting much better as time goes back. The company I currently work for has adopted <a href="https://slack.com/">Slack</a>. While we can make a channel for each project that we have and say our status there, there are also <a href="https://statushero.com/slack">bots</a> that can be integrated to do this for us.</p>
<p>Email is still used widely for communication. However, in these times of instant gratification, folks tend to think that we should instantly get a response after sending an email. That's definitely not the case as email is still a tool of asynchronous communication. People will respond when they can to email. In fact, if people are following the advice from the <a data-preserve-html-node="true" target="_blank" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307465357/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0307465357&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId=117b1ee6441c8aa7a5f5597bd41fdba6">The 4-Hour Workweek</a> book, then they will only check email two or three times a day.</p>
<p>Again, communication tools, especially for remote workers, are getting much better as time goes by. Slack may get beat by another tool or company that comes alone in the future. <a href="https://www.join.me/">Join.me</a>, <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a>, or <a href="https://screenhero.com/">Screenhero</a> are great tools for screensharing or pairing. There are even sites that can help you find <a href="https://hackhands.com/">coding</a> <a href="https://www.codementor.io/">help</a> instantly if you don't mind paying for it.</p>
<hr>
<p>With the current state of tools these days and the growth of remote workers, having daily status meetings should be going as a thing of the past. Hindering employees flow state and taking their precious, and often expensive, time are too high of a price to pay for software projects. When daily statuses can be just a few minutes of typing at the leisure of the person giving the status, I really believe that having mandatory meeting times are a thing of the past.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Book Review: Coders at Work</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/12/12/book-review-coders-at-work</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are quite a lot of interviews with software developers out there. Though, I doubt there are many that feature such an array of accomplished developers as <a href="http://amzn.to/2ih9hoq">Coders at Work</a> does. In this book, there are quite a few words of wisdom from developers who have been through the tough bugs and the long projects.</p>




 
   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1482935923&sr=8-1&keywords=coders+at+work&linkCode=li3&tag=dotnetmeditat-20&linkId=faaa1235710f30d5b3785bf238367646" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1430219483&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=dotnetmeditat-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1430219483" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 

<p>When I first got this book, most of the names I didn't recognize. In fact, there were only just a couple I did recognize by name - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a> and <a href="http://www.crockford.com/">Douglas Crockford</a>.</p>
<p>It was very interesting getting to know the other programmers in this book. Perhaps the most interesting reading in it, I felt, was the blurbs that introduce each person. Telling what they accomplished, what they're currently working on, and a sentence or two of what they talk about in the interview. The most fascinating thing is learning how each individual person being interviewed contributed to the world of computer science.</p>
<p>There were quite a few take aways from this book that may be applicable to everyday work. The biggest of these, though, is that most of the people being interviewed, when asking about how they debug a program, still use the very reliable <a href="http://everything2.com/title/printf%2528%2529%2520debugging">print statement</a>. In fact, there's this <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm">MIT open courseware lecture</a> on debugging that just goes over exactly that!</p>




 
   <iframe style="text-align: center" src="https://www.youtube.com/v/DkPsD58nUIE" height=325 width=545 frameborder=0></iframe>
 

<p>Here are a few other items of note that I learned while reading this book:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.jwz.org/">Jamie Zawinski</a> gives advice to not be afraid of what you don't know and that it's ok to ask someone who does about it.</p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/joshbloch">Joshua Bloch</a> says that it's important to know what you're trying to build before you get started. He suggested a talk he gave a quite a while ago now - How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters.</p>




 
   <iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aAb7hSCtvGw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 

<p><a href="http://joearms.github.io/">Joe Armstrong</a> has a few nice pieces of advice.</p>
<ul>
<li>He gives a really good debugging technique for finding errors which is that all errors will be three statements before or after the last place you changed the program.</li>
<li>He mentions that documentation tells you what the code is <em>supposed</em> to do. "Just read the code" will tell you what it <em>does</em>. Sometimes they aren't the same thing.</li>
<li>He mentions a nice talk by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hamming">Richard Hamming</a>, "You and Your Research", that has a lot of advice such as...</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't do good stuff, in good areas, it doesn't matter what you do.</p>
</blockquote>




 
   <iframe width="480" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1zDuOPkMSw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 

<p><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/simonpj/">Simon Peyton Jones</a> mentions an interesting paper on "Why Functional Programming Matters". Which has been turned into a talk!</p>




 
   <iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGQAP0GxlW8" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
 

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Thompson">Ken Thompson</a> knew for a long time that working 60, 80, or even 100 hours a week will definitely generate burnout. External deadlines also definitely generate stress.</p>
<hr>
<p>There's a ton more to learn from this book. From here you can step into the shoes of programming greats and learn the lessons they have learned.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Book Review: So Good They Can't Ignore You</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/12/13/book-review-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've always known books can have a profound impact on your life. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1455509124&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=dotnetmeditat-20&amp;linkId=72107aebc049855b9ff938c74512822c">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a> just may be one of those books for you. I believe it will be for me. Though, it's not one of those books where you gain so much after just reading it. This book gives you a bit of a guide on how you can be so good at your career, that you can make it become the dream job you often hear about people going after.</p>




 
   <a target="_blank"  href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455509124/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455509124&linkCode=as2&tag=dotnetmeditat-20&linkId=b7b145c3ebbacef4d0013df76d5b49f7"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&MarketPlace=US&ASIN=1455509124&ServiceVersion=20070822&ID=AsinImage&WS=1&Format=_SL250_&tag=dotnetmeditat-20" ></a><img src="//ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&l=am2&o=1&a=1455509124" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 

<h2 id="sections-of-the-book">Sections of the Book</h2>
<h3 id="ignore-the-passion">Ignore the passion</h3>
<p>In the first section of the book, the author goes into why you should ignore your passion for your career; why just following your passion isn't good enough for the job we all dream about.</p>
<h3 id="build-career-capital">Build career capital</h3>
<p>The second section details about being so good that they can't ignore you - or building what the author calls career capital. Career capital is rare and valuable skills within your line of work and getting good at them.</p>
<p>The author quotes a reader from his blog that very accurately details a key aspect of when you're building career capital:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Willing to grind out long hours with little recongition</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This section heavily reminded me of the episode of <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2015/12/14/derek-sivers-on-developing-confidence-finding-happiness-and-saying-no-to-millions/">The Tim Ferriss show with Derek Sivers</a> where Derek goes into, early in your career, say "yes" to everything. But when you get "so good they can't ignore you", you're free to say "no" to whatever comes up that you think doesn't allow you to gain any more career capital or that doesn't interest you.</p>
<p>The best thing to gain from this section is the aspect of <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/anders-ericsson-how-to-become-an-expert-at-anything-2016-6">deliberate practice</a>. Merely doing the practice of skills you enjoy will result in a plateau of skills. Doing practice and projects that result in being uncomfortable is a way to break away from the plateau and to continue building skills.</p>
<h3 id="gaining-control">Gaining control</h3>
<p>The fourth section details that having control in your job will help make it a dream job and loving the work that you do. However, there are two dangers in pursuing more control in your career.</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't have enough career capital to back up the extra control</li>
<li>Have enough career capital, but employeers will fight back against you having more control.</li>
</ol>
<p><a href="https://sivers.org/">Derek Sivers</a> comes in and gives advice that the book takes about knowing which of the two dangers you fall into so you can act accordingly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Do what people are willing to pay you for</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="having-a-mission">Having a mission</h3>
<p>Having a mission for your career helps create work that you love. To help find a mission, use the area just beyond the cutting edge of your career field, or the <a href="http://www.practicallyefficient.com/2010/09/28/the-adjacent-possible.html">adjacent possible</a>.</p>
<p>Once found, use small steps to get critical feedback in order to imporove quickly, or <a href="http://amzn.to/2i3aCPs">little bets</a>.</p>
<h3 id="book-conclusion">Book Conclusion</h3>
<p>An even more interesting part of the book is the conclusion. The conclusion details how the author used each of the sections from the book in his own life as a computer science professor. A very practical example of how these ideas can be used in your own life.</p>
<hr>
<p>Is this book a must read? If you want to get so good they can't ignore you, then I recommend it. I personally plan on making a plan myself to build up more career capital for myself.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>My Deliberate Practice Plan to Become a Better Programmer</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/12/21/my-deliberate-practice-plan-to-become-a-better-programmer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the <a href="https://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2016/12/13/book-review-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you">previous post</a>, I reviewed the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2iaoMvW">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>. I wanted to take the ideas and advice from there and to create my own plan for deliberate practice as a software developer. Here's what I came up with...</p>
<h2 id="continuous-learning">Continuous learning</h2>
<p>Being a software developer means to always be learning. Whether it's a new framework, new programming language, or a whole new programming paradigm learning something new is integral.</p>
<p>There are several ways to do this and I will try to incorporate all of them, though more will take more presidence and attentnion than others.</p>
<ul>
<li>Use sites like <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> and <a href="https://www.udemy.com/courses/development/">Udemy</a> for on-demand tutorials and training.<ul>
<li>Watch at least one course each one or two weeks, depending on the length of the course.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Watch at least one software presentation on YouTube or similar site.<ul>
<li>Watch one at least each week. This should generate some "Top 10" posts for everyone to enjoy or, if it's really good enough, a post about a specific presentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read at least one technical book each quarter.</li>
<li>Read and try to understand at least one journal paper on programming each quarter.<ul>
<li>I plan on starting with <a href="http://blog.fogus.me/2011/09/08/10-technical-papers-every-programmer-should-read-at-least-twice/">this list</a>. From there the <a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">Papers We Love</a> site looks to have a ton more to go through.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="practicing">Practicing</h2>
<p>Of course, one of the biggest and best things to do as a developer is to actually program something...anything to help put into practice what I've learned. The above methods are great for learning new things, but they have to be put to use, as well, otherwise I won't be able to retain what I've learned.</p>
<ul>
<li>Have at least one personal project going at a time.</li>
<li>Blog about things learned and always have a demo project for it, if possible.</li>
<li>Get certified, if available.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="being-uncomfortable">Being uncomfortable</h2>
<p>Doing deliberate practice often means being uncomfortable during the practice. This is an easy way to know if the practice is good or not. Here a couple of ways I can step outside of my comfort zone.</p>
<ul>
<li>Speak at a local user group at least once each quarter.</li>
<li>Try to speak at a conference at least once this year.</li>
<li>Do more screencasts instead of regular text posts for the blog.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keeping-track">Keeping track</h2>
<p>Now, none of the above doesn't mean all that much if I don't keep track and accoutable for each of these. Saying I'm going to do it doesn't mean I am going to do it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, blogging about each of the above items as much as possible</li>
<li>Use a time tracker such as <a href="https://getplan.co/">Plan</a> to keep a digital record and for some nice reports.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Since it's very close to the 2017 year, this is a great time to get started with this. </p>
<p>Do you have something you've done work very well for you but wasn't mentioned? What are your plans for having deliberate practice?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Getting Up and Running with FsLab for Data Science</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/12/27/getting-up-and-running-with-fslabs-for-data-science</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://sergeytihon.wordpress.com/2016/10/23/f-advent-calendar-in-english-2016/">FSAdvent</a> time is back this year! I'm going to use this post to start a new work in progress series on using F# for Dara science. This series will mainly consist of using <a href="https://fslab.org/">FsLab</a> to manipulate and visualize data. </p>
<h2 id="setting-up-your-environment">Setting Up Your Environment</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get setup in the IDE of you choosing is to just download the <a href="https://github.com/fslaborg/FsLab.Templates">basic template</a> of FsLab. This just references FsLab with <a href="http://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2014/10/22/introduction-to-paket">Paket</a> and gives a small script example. That's perfect for all that we need to do.</p>
<p>We're going to go through the script that it provides (with a bit of changes) in this post. Don't worry though, we'll go through a good bit of different aspects of the script in <a href="https://dotnetmeditations.com/?tag=fslabs">future posts</a>. We're just getting up and running here as sometimes that can be the biggest hurdle to get started in something new.</p>
<h2 id="generating-data">Generating Data</h2>
<p>FsLab comes with the <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/">FSharp.Data</a> package which includes a few very useful <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/tutorials/type-providers/">type providers</a> which help provide a safe and easy way to get data from external sources.</p>
<h3 id="world-bank-type-provider">World Bank Type Provider</h3>
<p>As previously mentioned, FSharp.Data comes with a few very useful type providers. One that we'll use here to help give us some real world data is the <a href="http://fsharp.github.io/FSharp.Data/library/WorldBank.html">World Bank type provider</a>. You could spend all day looking at what data it provides. For this post, though, we'll look at the US and EU percent added to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product">GDP</a> from industry.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-script">Setting Up Script</h2>
<p>Before we can access the World Bank type provider, though, we need to set up our script to access it. If you used the basic template it will already have FsLab setup with Paket so you would just need to run <code>paket.exe install</code> or build the project.</p>
<p>Now we can reference FsLab so first thing to do is to load the script to access everything we need from it:</p>
<pre><code>#load "packages/FsLab/FsLab.fsx"</code></pre><p>Now that we have the FsLab script loaded we can access all sorts of libraries from it by using the '<a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualfsharpdocs/conceptual/import-declarations-the-open-keyword-%5Bfsharp%5D">open</a>' keyword in F#.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">open Deedle
open FSharp.Data
open XPlot.GoogleCharts
open XPlot.GoogleCharts.Deedle</code></pre>
<p>We have a few external libraries we're using throughout our script:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using <a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/">Deedle</a> to explore our data. </li>
<li>The <code>FSharp.Data</code> library for our World Bank type provider.</li>
<li><a href="https://tahahachana.github.io/XPlot/">GoogleCharts</a> and GoogleCharts.Deedle to visualize our data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="getting-our-data">Getting Our Data</h2>
<p>Next we instantiate the World Bank type provider and from there we get a reference to the <code>Indicators</code> object for the US and for the EU.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let wb = WorldBankData.GetDataContext()

let us = wb.Countries.``United States``.Indicators
let eu = wb.Countries.``European Union``.Indicators</code></pre>
<p>From there we get the industry percent value added to the country's GDP and create a data <a href="http://bluemountaincapital.github.io/Deedle/series.html">series</a>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let usSeries = series us.``Industry, value added (% of GDP)``
let euSeries = series eu.``Industry, value added (% of GDP)``</code></pre>
<p>Now here is where some work on the data happens.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">abs (usSeries - euSeries)
|&gt; Series.sort
|&gt; Series.rev
|&gt; Series.take 5</code></pre>
<p>From here we get the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value">absolute value</a> of the difference of the two series, sort it, get the reverse of it, then take only the first five items. Looks like a bit, but we'll go into details of certain statistics for data science in future posts.</p>
<h2 id="charting-our-data">Charting Our Data</h2>
<p>Now that we have the data we want, let's chart it. The charting library in FsLabs will allow us to customize the chart as we see fit for visualizing. For this there is an <a href="https://tahahachana.github.io/XPlot/reference/xplot-googlecharts-configuration-options.html">Options</a> type that we can create. We'll just give a title and tell the legend to appear at the bottom.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let options = Options ( title = "% of GDP value added", legend = Legend(position="bottom") )</code></pre>
<p>Now we just need to tell the charting library to chart our data.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">[ usSeries.[2000 .. 2010]; euSeries.[2000 .. 2010] ]
|&gt; Chart.Line
|&gt; Chart.WithOptions options
|&gt; Chart.WithLabels ["US"; "EU"]</code></pre>
<p>We give it our data as an F# <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/language-reference/lists">list</a>, tell it to create a line chart, give it our options, and then tell what our labels are for our legend.</p>
<h2 id="executing">Executing</h2>
<p>Just run it all in F# Interactive. :)</p>

      <title>Book Review: Deep Work</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/12/28/book-review-deep-work</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Soon after I was about to finish <a href="https://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2016/12/13/book-review-so-good-they-cant-ignore-you">So Good They Can't Ignore You</a>, I stumbled upon a <a href="http://thoughtcatalog.com/ryan-holiday/2016/12/if-you-only-read-a-few-books-in-2017-read-these/">post</a> by <a href="http://ryanholiday.net/">Ryan Holiday</a> (another author I frequently follow), and it mentioned another book by <a href="http://calnewport.com/">Cal Newport</a> - <a href="http://amzn.to/2iAaW8m">Deep Work</a>. I thought a second and realized, "I think I have a book by that name." I go up to my library and, sure enough, there it is on my shelf. So when I finsihed the current book I was reading I picked this one up. I expected to receive similar benefits as I did in his previous book that I just finished and, sure enough, I got some good insights and advice from it as well.</p>




 
   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692/ref=as_li_ss_il?ref_=nav_custrec_signin&&linkCode=li3&tag=dotnetmeditat-20&linkId=b85992095f1ccdf33bb6944bf51c326b" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1455586692&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=dotnetmeditat-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1455586692" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 

<p>The first part of the book goes into how deep work is valuable, yet it's increasingly rare in our work environments. In fact, the author goes into two core abilities you must have to thrive in our work environments. You must have the abilities to do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>quickly master hard things</li>
<li>produce at an elite level in terms of both speed and quality</li>
</ul>
<p>These two abilities, though, depend on your ability to perform deep work. The author pretty much sums it up in this statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you don't produce you won't thrive - no matter how skilled or talented you are.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This makes sense, of course, but what we may currently produce may not be the best value that we can give.</p>
<h2 id="deliberate-practice-needs-deep-work">Deliberate practice needs deep work</h2>
<p>You may recall my current strategy for <a href="https://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2016/12/21/my-deliberate-practice-plan-to-become-a-better-programmer">doing deliberate practice for my programming career</a>. However, doing deliberate practice in itself is a practice in deep work because core components of deliberate practice are</p>
<ul>
<li>Having tight focus on a specific skill you’re trying to improve or an idea you’re trying to master</li>
<li>Receiving feedback so you can correct your approach to keep your attention exactly where it’s most productive</li>
</ul>
<p>The first core component of deliberate practice is getting deep work done on the skill or idea you're working on to master. The second component is essential so you can receive feedback to better tailor your next deep work session so you can continue to improve.</p>
<p>In order to produce great work that is valuable working for extended periods with no distractions at all is the key. This is essentially what deep work is, and it is essential to getting the deliberate practice you need to master a skill.</p>
<h2 id="enemies-of-deep-work">Enemies of deep work</h2>
<p>Earlier in this post I mentioned, as the author does several times in the book, that deep work is very valuable, yet it is very rare in current work enviornments. If it's so valuable why isn't it happening more?</p>
<p>The author gives several reasons why, but one of the biggest enemies of deep work is the need to always be connected or to always be reachable, whether through email or through a chat application. I always knew that email was a big distraction from my readings of <a href="http://amzn.to/2iEK1bu">The Four Hour Workweek</a>. You'll save so much time by scheduling when to check email and only do it, at most, twice a day. Another connection it drew in my mind was, in the <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/10/27/david-heinemeier-hansson/">Tim Ferriss Podcast episode with David Heinemeier Hansson</a>, DHH (as he's often refered as) goes into how they get so much work done. Once you listen its very simple how...they're able to get deep work done often. The whole company seems to love being able to get deep work done. From a post about <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/1209-forbes-misses-the-point-of-the-4-day-work-week">working four day work week</a> they mention how they reduce or completely remove the common distractions one can have during a typical work day. Meetings, email, and chat can be very distracting and will remove your concentration causing you to not get much deep work done.</p>
<p>As I say this, me and my company do a good bit of email and we have even <a href="https://medium.com/@JWood/how-slack-has-changed-our-company-culture-52dc7f238854#.dchr5cgeh">adopted Slack</a> as our main way of communication. This doesn't mean that we have to change our ways as a company or anything. This simply means that we have to be more mindful of how we are personally using these tools. </p>
<p>It's ok if we don't immediately respond to an email or chat message. Nothing work related is going to be life or death. The author even mentions a small study done with a group of management consultants at a very big company who were asked to disconnect for a day. Naturally, the consultants were nervous that the clients wouldn't like that, but it turned out that the clients didn't care. People will usually respect your right to become inaccessible as long as those periods are advertised in advance, and are able to get in touch with outside those periods.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-this-help-your-programming-career-">How can this help your programming career?</h2>
<p>The author cites a great book for developers on honing your craft, <a href="http://amzn.to/2iLP5eN">The Pragmatic Programmer</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We who cut mere stones must always be envisioning cathedrals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As developers we are constantly trying to hone our craft of programming. There's always something new to learn in our field, whether we want to stay up-to-date or to go in a different area. <a href="http://amzn.to/2iAaW8m">Deep Work</a> has good advice to do deliberate practice and ways to change your work day so you can get as much deep work done as possible.</p>
<p>Even in your day-to-day work what you produce can be greatly expanded if the rules of using deep work are applied. Outside of your daily work, incorporating these deep work rules can also be of great use. Going through training material or working on that side project will yield better and quicker results if they are done as deep work.</p>
<hr>
<p>There were some great insights from this book that I plan to incorporate in my own working life. Even turning off email and checking it on a schedule, I believe, can yield great results. I recommend this book if you feel like you can do more during the day but not quite sure of how it can all be done. It can be done and this book shows you a few ways to get there.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Xamarin Evolve 2016 Recap</title>
      <link>/blog/2016/5/4/xamarin-evolve-2016-recap</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I'm currently writing this at the Orlando airport waiting for my flight to head home back to South Carolina. Normally I couldn't wait to head back home after an event to relax and to just, well, be home. However, I'm a bit sad that I have to leave. I met some awesome folks, both Xamarin employees and other attendees. I have an absolute blast helping to give training for <a href="https://www.xamarin.com/university">Xamarin University</a>. And I got to experience Wizarding World and Jurassic Park at Universal.</p>
<p>I'll split this recap up into two sections, training and the actual conference, since they were two different event. Yet I couldn't imagine a better experience without doing both.</p>
<h3 id="training">Training</h3>
<p>At each Xamarin Evolve they include a two day bootcamp style training. It's basically a set of Xamarin University classes in two full days. It can be pretty intense, but you really get a lot out of it.</p>
<p>A colleague and I were asked to become adjunct trainers to help out with some of this training. When I was asked to join I first thought, "Crap, this is going to be really scary being up in front of folks for two full days!". But then I remembered that the best way to grow is to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacobmorgan/2015/02/11/why-getting-out-of-your-comfort-zone-is-the-best-thing-you-can-do-for-your-career/#57effad9652d">get out of your comfort zone</a>. So I accepted.</p>
<p>During the time up until the actual training, I learned a lot about how much preparing and practicing really does matter even though it's the last thing I want to do for it. It was also around that time that I heard a <a href="http://www.npr.org/2016/04/04/472162167/the-power-and-problem-of-grit">Hidden Brain episode on grit</a>. The lesson learned there is that using your grit to do things is the least fun experience, but it helps reap in the rewards once it's all done that much more. I then took preparing more seriously. I even took a hiatus from reading books! That's something that hardly ever happens.</p>
<p>The first day of training comes and I don't feel as nervous as I did during the practice sessions. My colleague did the introductions and welcome session. Then I was up for my first session to introduce Xamarin Forms. I then ended the day finishing half of the last session on local data. The next day I resumed the local data talk and went straight into web services, while my colleague finished out the rest of the day.</p>
<p>My absolute favorite part of the training was interacting with the students one-on-one and helping them when they had questions or issues during the labs. I definitely want to do this again and it's great inspiration to give more talks. I'm already thinking of what I can present on next and start preparing the materials for that.</p>
<h3 id="conference">Conference</h3>
<p>The conference itself was nothing short of amazing! Tons of great sessions that are already posted online (thank you, Microsoft!). I learned a great deal just by attending the ones that I did and will definitely take that home with me for future projects and learning.</p>
<p>Here are a few sessions I attended:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/UTX-xTr_Y70">If You Build It: Making Apps for Humans</a> - A wonderful presentation that showcases several interviews the presenter had with, not only some other developers, but with people you would encounter on the street with other careers besides tech. Honestly, this made me want to attempt something similar in my home town.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/H6UOrSyhTEE">Becoming a XAML Master</a> - I've done XAML in Xamarin Forms for around a year and half now and have come to really enjoy using it for building up my UI. This session covers a few extra tricks I can incorporate to utilize the power of XAML instead of having to write out extra code.</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/NtJVld7vJOs">Enhancing Your Mobile Application with Machine Learning</a> - I've been interested in data science and machine learning for a while now and this was the perfect session to get me started on the path of learning more of it. Great demos in this one!</li>
<li><a href="https://youtu.be/luLTVlbDAkk">Mobile Apps in F#</a> - Of course I have to go to an F# session! This one really drives examples of why you should try F# and some demos of using it in Xamarin applications. The async and MailboxProcessor stuff here is really digestible!</li>
</ul>
<p>Another one of the highlights of the conference was definitely going to Universal Wednesday night for Wizarding World and Jurassic Park. Rode on a couple of rides, finally got to try some butter beer, and just hung out with awesome folks.</p>
<p>Something that surprised me was the amount of F# fans that were also at the conference. I met several of them there and had tons of great discussions on the language itself and the community that surrounds it.</p>
<p>An interesting thing they do at Evolve is they have a section called the Darwin Lounge. This includes mini-hacks that you can do and win prizes and play with some of the awesome things they have also created</p>

<p>All this really sums up to is to just go to Xamarin Evolve every chance you get! It was and still is the best conference experience I've ever had!</p><p>And obligatory monkey photo...</p>

      <title>Git Commands I Can't Live Without</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/1/15/git-commands-i-cant-live-without</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://git-scm.com/">Git</a> has definitely become the main version control system developers use lately, and I admit, I got on that bandwagon when I got more into <a href="https://github.com/jwood803">GitHub</a>. I wanted to be more familiar with Git since I was doing more and more with GitHub.</p>
<p>I'll also admit, and I may be dating myself here, my first version control system that I used was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StarTeam">StarTeam</a>. Never heard of it? I don't blame you. Just look at the interface it had:</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1280"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1484658809488-U4YEKUNCJJ8C3WOSYNZP/starteam.jpg?format=original" alt=" StarTeam interface "/>  StarTeam interface [/caption] 
  

<p>I used that for a few years until the company got rid of that and went to <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/tfs/">Team Foundation Server</a>. Definitely a step up from StarTeam, but then I got started using Git. The more I use it the more I enjoyed using it.</p>
<p>However, I didn't get an appreciation for how powerful it was at first. I first started using Git when GitHub had their <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a> applications and used that for a while. I also used <a href="https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/">SourceTree</a> on one project I was on.</p>
<p>While these applications are great, I still wanted to learn more about the commands these applications are running in the background. That's when I started to <em>only</em> use Git through the command line. From that challenge I set myself, I realized there was <em>way</em> more to Git than these applications may show. Below is a list of commands I've been using quite often, but feel they may not be as well known.</p>
<h2 id="stash">Stash</h2>
<p>If you ever need to quickly put your current changes away so you can help work on something more important than your current task? Well, git <a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash">stash</a> is here to the rescue!</p>
<p>Just type in <code>git stash</code> and your changes are "stashed" away.</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="800"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1484668028466-F93I8ZK6O7FU35M4GGJH/git-stash.jpg?format=original" alt=" Stash newly tracked file "/>  Stash newly tracked file [/caption] 
  

<p>Now I can move on to working on something else while keeping my changes away for me to come back to.</p>
<p>You can have many as many stashes as you need, as well. If you're not sure of the ones you have, just do a <code>git stash list</code> and you'll see them all.</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1484668174157-77CSC5IXGE4ABF4G2I6Y/image-asset.png?format=original" alt=" List of git stashes "/>  List of git stashes [/caption] 
  

<p>Oh, but you want a meaningful message when you stash to you have an idea what changes are in it? Git has you covered there, too! Just do a <code>git stash save &lt;message here&gt;</code> and git will save the stash with your message.</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="800"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1484668504555-7IZ6CPE8XVETK27OU8CN/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" Save git stash with a message "/>  Save git stash with a message [/caption] 
  

<p>So we can save stashes in a couple of different ways, but what if we want to go back to a stash to continue our work? We have a couple of ways to do that, as well.</p>
<p>If you want to just apply the latest stash, just do a <code>git stash apply</code>.</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1484668639657-FDP3FMUH2ZFWDOP6EBF5/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" Applying the latest stash "/>  Applying the latest stash [/caption] 
  

<p>If we want to apply a specific stash we can just do <code>git stash apply &lt;stash name&gt;</code>.</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="750"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1484668762617-DWS1901HKCEOF1NVVOUH/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" Apply stash by name "/>  Apply stash by name [/caption] 
  























<figure >
  <blockquote data-animation-role="quote"
   data-animation-override>
    <span>“</span>Note that, if you’re in PowerShell and try this command it won’t work. To get it to work, you’d have to put the stash name in quotes.<span>”</span>
  </blockquote>
  
</figure>
<h2 id="diff">Diff</h2>
<p>Sometimes, you just want to double check the changes you've done before adding and commiting. In that case <code>git diff</code> is there for that.</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="500"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1484669326501-23O8KWANNYLG3EWOX204/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" Git diff results "/>  Git diff results [/caption] 
  

<p>No need to go to a separate application just to see what the changes are. You can just look at them in the command line.</p>

<hr /><p>With all this said, though, there is still a ton more commands and uses that Git has that I probably have never even heard of. Because of that, as y'all could probably guess, I got a book for it!</p>




 
   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Professional-Git-Brent-Laster/dp/111928497X/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1484659539&sr=8-1&keywords=professional+git&linkCode=li3&tag=dotnetmeditat-20&linkId=0e21f7d7477ba84a6a090f4f212a56a6" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=111928497X&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=dotnetmeditat-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&l=li3&o=1&a=111928497X" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 

<p>I'll definitely be reviewing this after I go through it to let y'all know how it is overall. Just going through the table of contents indicates that it covers a lot of really useful commands.</p>
<p>What git commands can you not live without?</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why I'm Reading Research Papers</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/1/3/why-im-reading-research-papers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In my recent post on <a href="https://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2016/12/21/my-deliberate-practice-plan-to-become-a-better-programmer">doing deliberate practice to become a better developer</a> I mentioned that I was going to spend some time to read and understand some research papers. This may seem a like an odd thing to do in order to become better at my craft, but I figured a little experimentation couldn't hurt. At the worst, I'll have a few research papers read and understood. Perhaps I'll even meet one of the co-authors and have something to engage in discussion with. However, I believe I may get a bit more out of it than just that.</p>
<h2 id="understand-latest-research">Understand Latest Research</h2>
<p>Seeing what the latest research trends are, I feel, can be quite beneficial in a practical sense. For instance, there's a paper that suggests that <a href="https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi14/osdi14-paper-yuan.pdf">simple testing can prevent most critical failures in software</a>. From reading the paper and <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2016/10/06/simple-testing-can-prevent-most-critical-failures/">Adrian Colyer's post</a> about it one can get a lot of insight about preventing most crashes in software. One having that insight, you can put it to good use in all of the software that you currently are developing.</p>
<h2 id="see-cutting-edge-technologies">See Cutting Edge Technologies</h2>
<p>I'm sure most of y'all have seen this graph on emerging technologies.</p>

<p>Keeping up with new research articles allows me to be a part of the early adopters. Whereas now, I'm most likely split between the Early Majority and the Late Majority. Getting in early to new technologies will give multiple advantages, such as being among the first to submit pull requests if they have their code on GitHub, or generating the first set of blog posts on the subjet.</p>
<p>For example, <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, a functional web language that outputs to JavaScript, was first introduced as a <a href="http://elm-lang.org/assets/papers/concurrent-frp.pdf">research paper</a>. While I would say it is still in the late stages of the Early Adopter phase, if I was able to get on it earlier soon after this paper came out I could be considered one of the go-to people for this technology and even could help contribute to future releases of it.</p>
<h2 id="try-to-understand-more-math">Try to Understand More Math</h2>
<p>A lot of computer science, and especially most of the research done in the field that I've seen, has a good bit of math behind it. While I took some math in my own studies of computer science, a lot of that was lost due to just not using it or keeping up with it.</p>
<p>While it's not necessary in day-to-day programming, it can be a bit helpful. Learning the math can help develop that extra bit of logic that will help in my daily programming, whether business logic or debugging.</p>
<hr>
<p>With these benefits in mind, I plan on reading a paper a quarter this year and see how that goes. I'll definitely report back any benefits, or lack of any, that I believe I receive during that process.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Learning Math for Programming</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/1/31/learning-math-for-programming</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When I went to college I <em>had</em> to take math. My degree is actually in Math and Computer Science. Why the math part, you ask? Well, the folks at the school figured that the math will help with a lot of the logic that comes with programming.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also that age old question when you first start learning programming...is there a lot of math involved? The answer is it depends. If you're planning to get a doctorate and do a lot of research, then you'll most likely use a lot of it. However, if you're just working for a company, then chances are you won't need hardly any math<sup data-preserve-html-node="true">*</sup>. If you're learning data science then some math is essential in order to gain insights from data or to understand machine learning algorithms.</p>
<p>In this post, we'll go over the most common types of math you may want to be familiar with to get the most out of your programming, and where you can start learning these concepts.</p>
<h2 id="discrete-math">Discrete Math</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_mathematics">Discrete math</a> is used quite a bit in programming. Whether it's understanding the theory of how integers work in programming languages or using boolean logic, you've probably come across it before.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-learn">Where to Learn</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/discrete-mathematics">Coursera</a> comes to the rescue here as there may not be too much around discrete math. </p>
<h2 id="algebra">Algebra</h2>
<p>Yep, even plain old algebra you probably didn't like in high school can be helpful. I actually have an example of this: back when I was doing tax software I needed to use some basic algebra to create a function. Of course, tax software relies heavier on math than most other software, so it's not unusual. Knowing that bit of algebra that I needed, though, really helped when creating the function and I may have had to spend a good bit of time Googling for some help.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-learn">Where to Learn</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra">Kahn Academy</a> is well known for their math courses and they definitely have a good algebra one.</p>
<p>For a book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2qh98qn">Practical Algebra</a> looks to be a good one to brush back up on your algebra.</p>
<h2 id="statistics">Statistics</h2>
<p>Statistics is needed for data scientists, not only to help get insights from your data but to also make sure variables that seem correlated to each other actually are statistically significat rather than not. That's not the easiest to do even if you plot your data. Statistics will give you a big advantage in understanding your data and how it can answer any questions you can throw at your data.</p>
<p>Need to see if an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A/B_testing">A/B test</a> has a significant difference? Then <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing">statistical hypothesis testing</a> can be of a great help.</p>
<h3 id="where-to-learn">Where to Learn</h3>
<p>Coursera has a great <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/probability-intro">intro to data course</a> that has really helped me out in learning some of the basics of statistics. The book they recommend, too, is actually really good.</p>
<p>As for books, I recommend a couple to start with. <a href="http://amzn.to/2Cj24ew">Practical Statistics</a> is a great introduction. If you want to focus more on the data science side of statistics then <a href="http://amzn.to/2qh62m9">Practical Statistics for Data Scientists</a> is a great one to get.</p>
<p>If you want to get a bit advanced, then I definitely recommend <a href="http://amzn.to/2qm0zea">Introduction to Statistical Learning</a>. This is mainly for getting deep in the machine learning algorithms, but still is an interesting read. You can also read it for free <a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/">online</a> instead of getting a physical copy. There's an even more advanced version of this too with <a href="http://amzn.to/2Chz1bb">The Elements of Statistical Learning</a>, which is also available for free <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/">online</a>.</p>
<h2 id="linear-algebra">Linear Algebra</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_algebra">Linear algebra</a> is a bit of a niche in programming. The only place I've really seen it used is for machine learning algorithms. Linear algebra, is mainly matrix manipulation. </p>
<h3 id="where-to-learn">Where to Learn</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra">Khan Academy</a> has some linear algebra courses that you can take. This is probably the most complete of them I've seen around.</p>
<p>For a book, mostly what you'll see are text books. That's not all bad, but sometimes a more general book is helpful. In that case there's <a href="http://amzn.to/2qgeT7P">Linear Algebra for Dummies</a>.</p>
<hr>
<p>While math isn't necessary for programming, I believe it can certainly help with the logic like my university thought. Learning the extra math also made me appreciate it more for what all math can teach us about the world. Also, don't think you're not good at math. This <a href="http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/03/math-for-programmers.html">old post</a> from Steve Yegge explains more about the way math is taught in schools and what we can do about it as programmers. You're not bad at math, you just need a better way to learn it.</p>
<p><sup data-preserve-html-node="true">*</sup>
Though, depending on the company you work for you may need it. For example, working for a financial institution may involve some knowledge of math.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>10 Sites Where You Can Get Programming Practice</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/2/9/10-sites-where-you-can-get-programming-practice</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Watching and reading programming tutorials are great! They give a curated view of a concept or new technology that may take hours longer to understand than going at it alone. However, much like math, <strong>programming is not a spectator sport.</strong> You need to practice in order to better understand the programming concept or technology in a real program.</p><p>There are a lot of ways one can do this, though, without having to fully set up an environment for each language or framework you want to learn.</p><p>Here are 10 sites that you can use to start learning new languages and other programming concepts. </p><h2 id="-code-wars-https-www-codewars-com-"><a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Code Wars</a></h2>



  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="1913"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495370432143-0A22FA1FM7IHCVXT6DWV/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" Code Wars profile view. "/>  Code Wars profile view. [/caption] 
  

<p>This is one of my favorite sites to go to, especially when I want some practice with a new language. They have most of the common languages already supported with a few more in beta so most likely you can get some practice in here.</p><p>All of the "katas", as they call the challenges, have always been challenging for me. Plus seeing other people's solutions I'm sure to learn something new. </p><h2 id="-hacker-rank-https-www-hackerrank-com-"><a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/">Hacker Rank</a></h2>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495370655105-V25B3NHKUC90Y7KAOLIM/hacker-rank.JPG?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Hacker Rank is another code challenge site, but a tad bit different. They also have competitions throughout the year where you can participate and see how you rank among other competitors. I've also seen some companies use this site as a first pass for interviewing candidates.</p><p>The nice thing about this site is that it pretty much emphasizes algorithms and data structures, which I consider two things that you could get the most out of if you practice it.</p><h2 id="top-coder">Top Coder</h2>



  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="782"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495371937322-373BQWC8TPTYGTNMHF4I/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" TopCoder compete login page. "/>  TopCoder compete login page. [/caption] 
  

<p>TopCoder is similar to HackerRank, but you can actually get paid for the challenges you compete in. This is a good way to see how you compare with other developers in the challenges and to challenge yourself to get better at certain types of programming, such as data structures, math, and string manipulations.</p>
<h2 id="-kaggle-0-"><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/">Kaggle</a></h2>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495377499578-5KRKK9Q37O73PT4FDEIO/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Kaggle is more suited for data scientists, but it's a place where you can find data to play around with. They also host their own competitions that can pay out.</p><p>You don't need to use this for data science, though. Since they offer a lot of data sets you can use them in for other applications as well. Want to create a web app with some of the data? Go for it! </p><h2 id="-project-euler-0-"><a href="https://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a></h2>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495387413897-O4ZPKJO7YQSECZ19D8N3/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=""/>
  


<p>Project Euler is probably one of the first sites with programming challenges and puzzles. This site is composed of mathematical problems that you can solve in code and the further you go the harder the math problems.</p>
<h2 id="-rosalind-http-rosalind-info-problems-locations-"><a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/">Rosalind</a></h2>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495387424387-LAR9GCHDKB0D3CIXDZEU/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=""/>
  


<p>Very similar to Project Euler, Rosalind gives challenges in regards to problems in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics">bioinformatics</a>. These challenges may be considsered a bit better since they solve more real world problems than just arbitrary math problems in Project Euler.</p>
<h2 id="-screeps-https-screeps-com-"><a href="https://screeps.com/">Screeps</a></h2>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495379528636-GLI5DZ6I2LXY0SGJD2BL/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>This is a fun one, especially if you are really interested in game programming. This site gives you the opportunity to code exercises as part of a Real Time Strategy game with JavaScript. Game programming is a totally different beast than doing web sites or any other business applications as it's a different way of thinking and experience that goes with it. This is especially great to get started with some game programming when you don't necessarily have a project of your own to work on.</p><h2 id="-codechef-https-www-codechef-com-"><a href="https://www.codechef.com/">CodeChef</a></h2>

<p>CodeChef is similar to TopCoder where they host several competitions and you can get paid for completing them. CodeChef holds those competitions monthly so you'll always have a chance to see how you stand against other programmers. There are definitely plenty of problems to practice before going into a competition and they are all ranked from easy to hard.</p>

<p>CodinGame is fairly similar to how Code Wars works, but the challenges are a bit more of a game. They are more turn based so with each "turn" you get new input and you must give new output based off of it. Similar to Screeps above, the challenges are like mini games you help code. When you run your test cases you can see your code in action as the game is being played, so you get some instant, and visual, feedback to how your code performs.</p>

<p>Ok, so this isn't much of an exercise site, but I feel that it's important enough to mention in this post. Why? Working on open source projects is one of the best things you can do as a developer, and this site helps make it easy. A lot of projects have been creating an "up-for-grabs" label on GitHub to let newer contributors get into their projects a lot easier by fixing easier bugs. Doing these will help you become a regular contributor to the project which will have more real world experience than doing other algorithmic or mathematical exercises.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Book Review: Becoming a More Effective Developer</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/4/11/book-review-becoming-a-more-effective-developer</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A lot of programming books teach you about a new framework, language, or computer science theory, but very few teach you how to actually be effective at your day job. The book, <a href="http://amzn.to/2uNZvhr">The Effective Engineer</a> is a great one to learn all the ways in which you can be the best developer you can be.</p>

<p>This book goes through three main points:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing the right mindset</li>
<li>Executing effectively</li>
<li>Building long term value</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these has some really good and actionable insights on how you can become better as a programmer.</p>
<h2 id="developing-the-right-mindset">Developing the right mindset</h2>
<p>As Carol Dweck mentions in her book <a href="http://amzn.to/2FeNtm3">Mindset</a>, the most successful people have a certain mindset in terms of how they view their learning. They believe that your brain can be changed and you can learn anything once you put in the work. That's definitely true for programmers.</p>
<h3 id="continuous-learning">Continuous Learning</h3>
<p>A large part of being a software developer is that you are continuously learning new things. Whether new frameworks, languages, or software theory, there is no shortage of things to learn. </p>
<p>A majority of the time this learning comes from actual work on the job. No longer being able to learn on the job is a reason a lot of developers change jobs, so it's definitely cared about. Sometimes, though, that learning may need to be supplemented outside of the job. This is where you hear some developers doing projects and learning during nights and weekends.</p>
<p>The book goes through a few ways developers can actually do this learning, such as reading code from developers who are more experienced and to have them review your own code.</p>
<h3 id="prioritize">Prioritize</h3>
<p>One of my favorite authors, <a href="https://tim.blog/">Tim Ferriss</a> often talks about being efficient vs. being effective to help <a href="https://blog.trello.com/productivity-tips-from-tim-ferriss">boost productivity</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Focus on doing the right things (efficiency) vs doing things well (being efficient).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Doing things to be efficient may include items such as replying to emails, updating status reports more than they need to be, and other tasks that make it seem like you're busy but doesn't actually contribute much to the project you're working on.</p>
<p>That's where prioritization comes in. Once you take some time each day or week to prioritize what needs to be done, you'll have a clear way to move forward with the actual project.</p>
<p>This is similar to <a href="http://amzn.to/2m7RCj9">Getting Things Done</a> in that you define clear tasks and prioritize the ones that need to be done. I would also argue to break up bigger tasks into much smaller ones.</p>
<h2 id="executing-effectively">Executing effectively</h2>
<p>Now that we have the right mindset for our productivity, we also need to know how to execute them. A few things from the book stand out in what I believe will help the most.</p>
<h3 id="master-your-environment">Master Your Environment</h3>
<p>Do you use Visual Studio for all of our development? Then knowing as much as you can about it can save you so much time in terms of keyboard shortcuts or knowing when to move to the command line for certain tasks. Speaking of the command line, knowing PowerShell or bash can save you a ton of time as there are snippets and commands that can do a lot that you may not even know of.</p>
<h3 id="improve-your-estimation-skills">Improve Your Estimation Skills</h3>
<p>All too often you, as a developer, will get asked by your boss or a manager how long a certain task will take. How often have you said, "I don't know?" Improving your estimation skills is an easy way to be thought of as a senior programmer. </p>
<p>The main way to improve this is to just keep track of your tasks. Once you are asked to estimate you can refer back to your tasks and get an idea of how long it took you to do something similar.</p>
<p>There's also the book <a href="http://amzn.to/2CHDILF">Software Estimation</a> that can give a lot more details in improving your estimation details.</p>
<h2 id="building-long-term-value">Building long term value</h2>
<p>To be the best programmer you can be is to build long term value for your company and your clients. The book offers some great ways in order to help you build that long term value.</p>
<h3 id="balance-quality-with-practicality">Balance Quality with Practicality</h3>
<p>How often have you come across this scenario: you implement a new feature and the deadline is very close, however your boss wants you to go ahead and get it in to start testing. You mention how many more tests you need to write, yet your boss says to not worry about that and just check it in. Often referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a>, us programmers can perfectionists in that we want our code to be perfect before we send out for all to work on and see.</p>
<p>Having this type of balance on having your work be perfect vs. being practical in your work can be beneficial in terms of providing value to your company or clients.</p>
<h3 id="invest-in-your-team">Invest in Your Team</h3>
<p>I think the biggest thing you can do for long term value is investing in the team. This can be done in many ways, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Providing a nice way to onboard new team members: Having a good onboarding solution will make new team members so much more productive and have them committing code within their first week on the job. This leads to higher morale overall across the team.</li>
<li>Collaborating on all aspects of the code: This includes having efficient code reviews on all pull requests, and team members not afraid to volunteer for certain bug fixes or features.</li>
<li>Building a great culture: This can be a hard one to accomplish, but if done correctly this will build higher morale with the team which will reflect team members making sure they give everything their best.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course there are other ways to help invest in your team, but these are some of the ways that can have the most impact.</p>
<hr>
<p>This book is definitely worth reading for a lot of ideas on how you can easily improve your effectiveness as a programmer. For even more you can checkout the <a href="http://www.effectiveengineer.com/blog">book's blog</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Best Pluralsight Videos to Help Your Career</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/4/13/best-pluralsight-videos-to-help-your-career</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluralsight</a> has certainly grown over the years. I remember when it first started and it had only courses that were just .NET based and maybe a few others within the Microsoft stack. Now they cover, not only a wide range of development topics, but a big range of creative, admin, and business topics. With that, several videos about how you can get better at your career and as a developer have come up. Here are my favorite courses that I feel give great, actionable advice on how to get better.</p>
<h3 id="-becoming-an-outlier-reprogramming-the-developer-mind-by-cory-house-1-"><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/career-reboot-for-developer-mind/table-of-contents">Becoming an Outlier: Reprogramming the Developer Mind by Cory House</a></h3>
<p>This is a great course that is very actionable. Cory goes into several things that you can use right after you watch it on how to make yourself an outlier, or an above average developer. Of course, it's going to be some work, but all that work will pay off. I tend to refer to this course when I need a bit of extra motivation to be an outlier. </p>
<h3 id="-play-by-play-crafting-a-brand-for-growth-and-prosperity-2-"><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/play-by-play-crafting-a-brand-for-growth-and-prosperity/table-of-contents">Play by Play: Crafting a Brand for Growth and Prosperity</a></h3>
<p>The Play by Play is an interesting concept. Usually it's where you follow a developer as they are making an application or doing something similar to their day-to-day programming and they talk through what they're doing and what they're thinking. In this case, it's more of an informal discussion where <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt</a> and <a href="http://klint.co/">Lars Klint</a> discuss how they update their brand and image to rise above average and help get themselves noticed. They talk about their experiences so you can learn from them and incorporate them into your own career.</p>
<h3 id="-learning-to-program-being-a-better-programmer-5-"><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/learning-program-better-programmer/table-of-contents">Learning To Program - Being A Better Programmer</a></h3>
<p>Programming is mostly a job of learning. Developers are constatly learning new technologies and frameworks. In this course, <a href="http://irisclasson.com/">Iris Classon</a> and <a href="http://odetocode.com/">Scott Allen</a> help you learn how to learn in terms of programming. Probably the best section is the "Learning Plan" section. You can't really learn that much if you don't have a plan, from going through tutorials, practicing, and retaining what you've done.</p>
<h3 id="-get-involved-6-"><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/get-involved/table-of-contents">Get Involved!</a></h3>
<p>One of the best things to do while being a programmer is to, well, get involved. There are a ton of ways to get invovled and this course details those ways. From the usual getting into open source projects to participating in local user groups. Why get involved? Getting involved will help your personal brand, which the first two courses go into much deeper. Getting involved gets you known around the community. Getting involved with the local community lets you meet people easier and, who knows, you could be talking with a member of the community you meet and come up with the next innovation in programming.</p>
<h3 id="-the-future-of-technology-careers-7-"><a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/future-technology-careers/table-of-contents">The Future of Technology Careers</a></h3>
<p>Programming is a very dyanmic career. The reason developers are always learning is that new technologies and frameworks are always coming out for us to learn. One of those will become very popular and you would need to get up-to-speed quite quickly to meet the needs of a client or employer. This course was done in 2015 and predicts quite a few things that are still emerging, such as virtual reality, big data or data science, and artificial intelligence.</p>
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: <a href="http://danappleman.com/">Dan Appleman</a> just released an awesome new course on <a href="https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/technology-keeping-up/table-of-contents">keeping up with technology</a>. It's done very well and goes well with the other courses in this post.</p>

<hr /><p>PluralSight definitely offers a lot and new courses are added each day. While I wish they offered more in terms of exercises or projects, they are top notch in terms of video tutorials. The ones I highlighted in this post are great to help you use the other more techical courses that they offer. I hope you get as much out of these courses as much as I have!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Why C# is Still Worth Learning Today</title>
      <link>/blog/2017/5/19/why-c-is-still-worth-learning-today</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days with all the programming rage is JavaScript and related web frameworks or <a href="">data science</a> with Python or R, C# isn't as popular as it used to be. Of course, that makes sense. Programming languages come and go as languages and compilers are evolving. However, I think C# is still a good language not only to learn but to master.</p>
<h3 id="it-used-to-be-very-popular">It <em>Used</em> to be Very Popular</h3>
<p>With the recent release of <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends">StackOverflow Trends</a> we can see how popular tags have been on the platform. Considering how popular and influential StackOverflow is in terms of getting help, this data is worthwhile to look at.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the current list of popular languages according to <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">TIOBE index</a> (we'll talk more about this further down this post).</p>




  
      <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/trends?utm_source=so-owned&utm_medium=blog&utm_campaign=trends&utm_content=blog-link&tags=java%2Cc%2Cc%2B%2B%2Cpython%2Cc%23%2Cvb.net%2Cjavascript%2Cassembly%2Cphp%2Cperl%2Cruby%2Cvb%2Cswift%2Cr%2Cobjective-c"  target="_blank" ><img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495204032574-KRSWK0GZOK7QVVKMQNJP/trends.jpg?format=original" alt=""/></a>
  

<p>That's a lot to gather in one chart, so let's break it down a bit.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495230045436-SGIUCFWNIY93YSIKQCBR/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>From this graph, C# was very much used due to the amount of questions on StackOverflow back around 2009.</p>
<p>Sure, it has steadily gone down in time and will probably continue to decrease. But think, all of those companies who picked up C# and .NET back when it was much bigger...they need to support those applications. Some may decide to rewrite them depending on their budget and what kind of experience their current developers have, but I'm sure C# will continue to run a lot of those applications in the future.</p>
<p>This reminds me of the current state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COBOL">Cobol</a>. A <a href="https://blog.hackerrank.com/the-inevitable-return-of-cobol/">HackerRank</a> post mentions an interesting statistic about Cobol:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>70-80% of all business transactions worldwide are written in COBOL today</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a lot of businesses still running Cobol! I believe it'll be the same with C#.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-still-popular-">It's still popular...</h3>
<p>Every year for the past few years StackOverflow has conducted a big <a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016">developer survey</a>. What they find there can be very interesting!</p>
<p>Here's the most popular technologies of 2016:</p>




  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="864"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1495248280690-IGCOQMHGJ9NFLZXJMSSI/image-asset.jpeg?format=original" alt=" https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-most-popular-technologies "/>  https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2016#technology-most-popular-technologies [/caption] 
  

<p>Most popular doesn't always mean that developers enjoy working with it, does it? In terms of C#, it seems developers still enjoy it!</p>

<h3 id="c-is-here-to-stay">C# is here to stay</h3>
<p>Developers still ejoy working with it, but what about the industry itself? All of the data presented so far was from StackOverflow which was derived from surveys, where people can lie if they want, or from their own data with tags, which just means people ask a lot of questions about it. The TIOBE index mentioned earlier gathers a lot more data. Here's their list of the top five languages:</p>

<p>Still impressive to be in the top five and I don't see it getting below that very much in the near future.</p>

<hr /><p>With all the debate about what will be next to learn to keep you on the edge in terms of development, a good solid understanding in C# is still a contender. Not bleeding edge, of course, unless you're getting alpha of the newest C# versions to try out new language features.</p>
<p>C# is a great languge to learn from since the tooling is great and there is no shortage of tutorials and courses for it.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Martial Arts Lessons You Can Apply to Your Software Career</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/1/10/lessons-from-martial-arts-you-can-apply-to-your-software-career</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Every since high school I've been in love with the martial arts. The history, culture, and lessons that all of them give to the practitioners. I believe the lessons taught in the martial arts school can be applied to all aspects of life, and that includes your software developer career.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll detail some martial arts lessons and also how they can help your software development career.</p>
<h2 id="leave-your-ego-at-the-door">Leave your Ego at the Door</h2>
<p>This lesson is mainly from Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ). A lot of people who just get started in BJJ learn this. They soon realize that there's always someone better and there is nothing wrong with someone putting you in a submission. You learn from it and move on, and that's it. You don't worry about how you should have seen the submission coming or how you should have defended. Your ego is the enemy and it can prevent you from learning.</p>
<p>The same can be said in software development. How many times have you seen someone get upset during a code review when someone goes over their code? Code reviews are to better the overal product and reduce the number of bugs you get so they are helpful to have. Plus, I've learned several things from folks reviewing my code, so it's helpful to look at it as a learning experience.</p>
<h2 id="be-like-water">Be Like Water</h2>
<p>You may have heard of this quote from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Lee">Bruce Lee</a>. In fact, there's a fairly popular video about it:</p>




 
   <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/APx2yFA0-B4?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
 


<p>What this is saying is to keep your mind open to new things and ideas. Doing this will allow you to see things differently and in a new perspective.</p>

      <title>Book Review: Python Tricks</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/1/12/book-review-python-tricks</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you've been around Python for a while, then you're probably familiar with <a href="https://dbader.org/">Dan Bader</a>. He likes to help people up their Python game and share his knoweledge of the language. Because of that, he released his own book, <a href="https://amzn.to/2NDMeE0">Python Tricks</a>.</p>




 
   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Python-Tricks-Buffet-Awesome-Features/dp/1775093301/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1515767023&sr=8-1&keywords=python+tricks&linkCode=li3&tag=dotnetmeditat-20&linkId=930e65e2282584f1897a0024def1cee4" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1775093301&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=dotnetmeditat-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&l=li3&o=1&a=1775093301" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 

<p>The book has seven sections of Python goodness:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean Python Patterns</li>
<li>Effective Functions</li>
<li>Classes</li>
<li>Data Structures</li>
<li>Loops</li>
<li>Dictionaries</li>
<li>Productivity</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at an example in each of the above items so you can have an idea of what is in the book. These examples are ones that I have learned from when reading the book. Code examples in this post are my own.</p>
<h2 id="clean-python-assertions">Clean Python - Assertions</h2>
<p>The very first tip in this book goes over using assertions in Python. Assertions, if you aren't familiar, is a way to well, assert if a condition is true. More specifically, a condition in which you expect to be true. If you have an assertion and it turns out to false, it will throw an <code>AssertionError</code>.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553979344991-T526NFZVUCVQGZYR24VV/2019-03-30+16_55_19-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>If an assertion is caught it's a good idea to see why. Doing so will allow you to catch bugs that you may not have been able to catch before which is why having assertions are helpful.</p><h2 id="effective-functions-args-and-kwargs-">Effective Functions - <code>*args</code> and <code>**kwargs</code></h2><p>When starting out in Python you may come across a method like the below:</p><pre><code>def main(*args, **kwargs):
    print(args)
    print(kwargs)</code></pre><p>Seeing something like this for the first time and, like me, you'll wonder what in the world that means.</p><p><code>*args</code> are extra positional arguments you can pass in. The <code>*</code> in front tells it to gather all of those into a tuple. So if we take the method definition from above we can print the <code>*args</code>.</p><pre><code>main("hello", "world")</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553981783987-DATAVQXW7401NOL0PYXI/2019-03-30+17_36_06-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>The <code>**kwargs</code> parameter does the same thing, but instead of a tuple it will be a dictionary since the <code>kw</code> in front of the <code>args</code> stands for "key word".</p><pre><code></code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553981822140-FKH824VW7SWJTOJO3Q2Y/2019-03-30+17_36_50-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="classes-named-tuples">Classes - Named Tuples</h2><p>Tuples in Python are essentially a collection that is immutable. That is, once it's definied it can't be changed. To easily spot a tuple, the values in it will be enclosed by parentheses.</p><pre><code>t = (1, 2, 3, 4, "five")
t</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553982558925-LY1OX30CTAAGTPZ2KG30/2019-03-30+17_48_47-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>However, if we want to get access to get access to the first item of the tuple, there's no dot notation to give us access to it.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553982671347-ZPF9TCXN26TJDAEU8PLV/2019-03-30+17_50_58-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Though, we can use slicing to access it.</p><pre><code>t[0]</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553983052987-3K696K8T94SCHQE9EY98/2019-03-30+17_57_26-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>With a <code>NamedTuple</code> we can create a tuple and access items in it with the dot notation. </p><pre><code>from collections import namedtuple

t = namedtuple("t", ["one", "two", "three", "four", "five"])

items = t(1, 2, 3, 4, "five")</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553983198823-QC7X0HYHCLQ13NTCQZ93/2019-03-30+17_59_51-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="data-structures-sets">Data Structures - Sets</h2><p>Sets are a data structure that simply gives unique values. This can be quite useful if you want to remove duplicates from a list.</p><pre><code>set([1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 5, 3])</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553983669984-YIQDUAUIH4NDR3ISCLJ1/2019-03-30+18_07_38-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="loops-comprehensions">Loops - Comprehensions</h2><p>List comprehensions are perhaps one of my favorite things in Python. It is essentially sytactic sugar on top of using a <code>for</code> loop and, once understood, can be easier to read since it is only in one line. For example, let's say we have the below loop:</p><pre><code>item = []
for i in range(0, 10):
    item.append(i + 1)

print(item)</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553985827065-TGPQ5BHJP5YJED1J32OY/2019-03-30+18_43_38-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>We can rewrite it using a list comprehension:</p><pre><code>[i + 1 for i in range(0, 10)]</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553985858780-6G3FQ20AHXFI87RNNFB5/2019-03-30+18_44_09-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>What if we need an <code>if</code> statement in the loop, like below?</p><pre><code>item = []
for i in range(0, 10):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        item.append(i + 1)

print(item)</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553985886989-69JXXOF7WP82GQPKFK2B/2019-03-30+18_44_39-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>That can also be broken down into a list comprehension.</p><pre><code>[i + 1 for i in range(0, 10) if i % 2 == 0]</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553985912305-EB7OZVN20OAHW782R4GN/2019-03-30+18_45_05-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="dictionaries-default-values">Dictionaries - Default Values</h2><p>Often, when checking if a value is in a dictionary, it's not always known if that value is in the dictionary in the first place. The <code>get</code> method on dictionaries is a good way to get the value if it is in the dictionary or to return a default value if it is not in the dictionary. </p><p>For example, let's say we have the below dictionary.</p><pre><code>d = {"x": 1, "y": 2}</code></pre><p>We can get the <code>y</code> value with the <code>get</code> method.</p><pre><code>d.get("y")</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553986593192-GPBEQSGZUO1DL4K40SAA/2019-03-30+18_56_17-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>But if we try to get the value from <code>z</code> which doesn't exist in the dictionary, we can give a second parameter to the <code>get</code> method to return that value as default if the key doesn't exist.</p><pre><code>d.get("z", 0)</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553986618367-WLVUTBUACW1ZMYOAEHA3/2019-03-30+18_56_53-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Also, if we don't specify the default value and the key doesn't exist in the dictionary, the <code>get</code> method won't return anything.</p><pre><code>d.get("z")</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553986665529-D9INS3HMLXR2JK5F99PO/2019-03-30+18_57_36-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="productivity-dir-">Productivity - <code>dir</code></h2><p>While Python is a great language it is also a bit weird to work with when trying to explore through code what methods or properties a variable can have. That's one of the nice things with C# and it being a typed language. I can use the dot notation and intellisense to see what is available on a variable. With Python, though, that may not always work even in great editors such as PyCharm and Jupyter.</p><p>This is where the <code>dir</code> method comes to the rescue. Using this method we can see exactly what method and properties are on a variable.</p><p>For example, let's say you wanted to see what all is avilable on a list object.</p><pre><code>x = [1, 2]
dir(x)</code></pre>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553987263023-ALIJPMH048S8QJ07EU1S/2019-03-30+19_06_30-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>The <code>dir</code> method has saved me a lot of time trying to find what's available on objects instead of having to hunt down the documentation.</p><hr><p>I consider myself a beginner to intermediate in Python. Some of the tricks in here I've seen before, such as asserts and list comprehensions, but most of the ones in this book I haven't. I definitely learned quite a bit more about using Python. Both for cleaner code and to utilize what the language has to offer whether than defaulting to what I already know from another language.</p><p>Whether you're just beginning or a pro in Python, there's something in this book to learn from. Maybe there'll be a second edition soon.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Completing the Microsoft Professional Program for Data Science</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/1/27/completing-the-microsoft-professional-program-for-data-science</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Microsoft has two data related certifications in their <a href="https://academy.microsoft.com/en-us/professional-program/">Microsoft Professional Program</a> - one for Data Science and another for Big Data. I recently completed the one for data science and want to share my experience to others interested in doing the same.</p>
<h2 id="program-details">Program Details</h2>
<p>The data science program consists of 10 courses, with one being an orientation and the last being a final capstone project. In order to get credit you do need to receive a passing grade (70% for all courses other than the capstone in which you need 76%), and to purchase a verified certificate. The certificates cost $99 so the whole course will cost you $990. A good chunk of change if your employer won't reimburse you on it, so I would definitely check that first before committing the time.</p>
<p>The main course materials cover the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Statistics</li>
<li>Coding in R or Python</li>
<li>Machine Learning</li>
<li>Visualizing Data</li>
</ul>
<p>The courses all differ in how they do the grades, but usually they have either a lab or quiz after each section and a final exam at the end of the course. The questions usually allow you two chances to get the correct answer, but some may only offer one.</p>
<h2 id="my-experience">My Experience</h2>
<p>Most of the courses are easy as long as you pay attention to the lectures and actually do the labs. The instructors were all knowledgable and presented the materials well, however, I think there was an issue with the materials involving the math and statistics. </p>
<p>To go over the math portions to try to explain a concept, they showed slides of the formulas and just talked about what the formulas mean...and that's basically it. I don't think this was needed at all since the concepts were explained much better once they were put as demos. Just going over formulas isn't the best way to teach any kind of math. Showing the applications of it, though, is. Then if you need to go back to the formula you can while relating it to the application.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, the statistics course was the hardest for me. I barely made a passing grade. The course structure was slightly different</p>
<h2 id="tips">Tips</h2>
<p>A couple of things that may be useful to you if you do decide to take this course:</p>
<ul>
<li>Audit the course first. Then, once you know you've gotten a passing grade, purchase the certificate. There's nothing worse than paying for something and come to find out you barely missed the passing grade and you've payed $99 for nothing.</li>
<li>The statistics course was harder than expected. Not only do they only allow one choice to choose an answer instead of the usual two, the questions don't make it clear what part of the lectures it comes from. I would definitely go back over the lectures after reading each question. They will mostly come from the Excel portions of the lectures.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Would I take this course again if I needed to? I probably would, but I love to learn. I did learn a lot of things, such as tuning models in Azure Machine Learning, how awesome PowerBI is and all the things you can do with it, and time series analysis concepts. </p>
<p>In the end, you get a certificate that you can share on LinkedIn or to your boss. However, keep in mind that there's still tons more to learn and projects to work on to futher solidify the concepts from this course.</p>

      <title>Bias in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/2/4/bias-in-machine-learning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You hear a lot about machine learning and how it's transforming industries, but there may be something about these algorithms you may not have heard - its biases.</p>
<p>A bias is favoring one group over the others and these machine learning algorithms are supposed to prevent decisions based on any type of bias a person would have. However, the machine learning models are only as good as the data that you give it. The historical data that we have has a built in bias that we need to address.</p>
<p>I came across an interesting talk from the 2017 <a href="https://nips.cc/">NIPS</a> conference that goes over this very well.</p>




 
   <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/fMym_BKWQzk?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
 

<p>There's also an interesting podcast episode of the <a href="https://www.npr.org/programs/ted-radio-hour/580617765/can-we-trust-the-numbers?showDate=2018-01-26">TED Radio Hour</a> that goes over algorithmic bias.</p>




 
   <iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/580617998/580650782" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player"></iframe>

<p>Researchers know this is a problem in algorithms and they are actively doing research on how to better beat these biases from machine learning models. Until then, though, we would need to be diligent when testing our models to make sure these types of biases aren't integrated in our data.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>5 Best Places to Read Research Papers</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/2/6/5-best-places-to-read-research-papers</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Since I'm starting to read more and more research papers, I thought I'd give a small rundown on where I'm finding these papers. You can find a lot available for free, and the places below are my favorite ones to go to.</p>
<h2 id="-arxiv-https-arxiv-org-list-cs-ai-recent-"><a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent">Arxiv</a></h2>
<p>Arxiv (I believe it is pronounced "archive") is the most popular place to find research papers. There are several subsections but the ones to look at are <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.LG/recent">machine learning</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent">artificial intelligence</a>. There is just so much you find here. In fact, there's so much there's an <a href="https://github.com/karpathy/arxiv-sanity-preserver">open source version</a> of Arxiv called <a href="http://www.arxiv-sanity.com/">Arxiv Sanity</a>.</p>
<h2 id="github">GitHub</h2>
<p>Yep, the main place to find code is also a great place to find collections of research papers. Here are just a few of those collections to get you started.</p>
<h3 id="-papers-we-love-https-github-com-papers-we-love-papers-we-love-"><a href="https://github.com/papers-we-love/papers-we-love">Papers We Love</a></h3>
<p>Papers We Love are a community of people who like to read computer science papers and then talk about what they have read. It's like a book club for computer science research. While this isn't solely for machine learning or AI there are some papers that touch on those fields.</p>
<h3 id="-machine-learning-papers-https-github-com-solaris33-awesome-machine-learning-papers-"><a href="https://github.com/solaris33/awesome-machine-learning-papers">Machine Learning Papers</a></h3>
<p>While this repository isn't the most up-to-date having papers from <a href="https://nips.cc/">NIPS</a> in 2016, they do link out to the GitHub repositories so you can access the source code along with reading the paper.</p>
<h3 id="-deep-learning-papers-https-github-com-terryum-awesome-deep-learning-papers-"><a href="https://github.com/terryum/awesome-deep-learning-papers">Deep Learning Papers</a></h3>
<p>This repository has quite a lot of papers in it. It has them broken down by category such as natural language process and reinforcement learning. This doesn't have just papers, either. There are some links to video lectures and other blogs you can go to as additional resources.</p>
<p>Quick tip if you want to find more more GitHub lists that are curated, there's a lot of people who have lists of topics under the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">awesome badge</a>. Doing a search for <code>github awesome</code> and then what you're looking for will yield some interesting results.</p>
<h2 id="-google-scholar-https-scholar-google-com-"><a href="https://scholar.google.com/">Google Scholar</a></h2>
<p>This is more of a search than a list of articles, but you can find a lot here. You can even create alerts on keywords or by researchers you want to follow to see what they are citing.</p>
<h3 id="-machine-learning-subreddit-https-www-reddit-com-r-machinelearning-"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/">Machine Learning subreddit</a></h3>
<p>Reddit is always a good place to find a community in topics that you're interesting in. Machine learning and sharing interesting papers has a place there as well.</p>
<p>While I'm on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/">data science subreddit</a> a lot, the machine learning one is great for research, projects, and discussions. Often times, on the research posts, you'll get some extra context from the comments which can be more valulable than the paper itself.</p>
<h2 id="tech-company-sites">Tech Company Sites</h2>
<p>Some of the big tech companies have their own research entities, such as <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/">Google's Deep Mind</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/">Microsoft Research</a>, and <a href="https://research.fb.com/">Facebook Research</a>. Often times, they'll publish their papers on their sites for anyone to access. Even better, sometimes they'll put out a blog post that highlights what a paper is about and will include some more feature rich graphics to go along with it that you can't always put into a research publication to help you understand what's going on in the paper.</p>
<h2 id="specific-journal-sites">Specific Journal Sites</h2>
<p>There are some interesting journals that tailor specifically for publishing your work. Like ArXiv, all of the papers here are free to access. You have the <a href="http://www.jmlr.org/">Journal of Machine Learning Research</a> which is specific to only machine learning topics. The <a href="http://www.jds-online.com/">Journal of Data Science</a> which encompasses the huge field of data science, which you'll probably see a lot of statistics papers in here as well. And then there's the <a href="https://journal.r-project.org/">R Journal</a> which has papers where the code was specifically written in R, so you may have more statistics topics in here, as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>Hopefully, with these resources you'll be able to find research papers that will keep you busy for quite a long time. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Research Minute: Useful Things about Machine Learning</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/2/6/research-minute-useful-things-about-machine-learning</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've done book reviews in the past, but as I mentioned in my post on <a href="https://jonwood.co/blog/2016/12/21/my-deliberate-practice-plan-to-become-a-better-programmer">deliberate practice</a>, I intended to get into more research papers. I don't have any academic experience in reading research papers, I can't quite be able to reach the very math centric or abstract papers (at least not yet), but there are quite a few that, with some patience, anyone can read and learn from.</p>
<p>With that, I'll do my best to summarize the more interesting research papers I read here.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-read-a-research-paper">How to Read a Research Paper</h3>
<p>When first getting started with reading research papers is that you don't read the whole thing in one pass through. Read a bit of the Abstract and Introduction sections to make sure it's a paper that looks interesting.</p>
<p>For more on how to read a research paper, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWN3xxRkmTPmbKwht9FuE5A">Siraj Raval</a> has an interesting video:</p>

<h2 id="a-few-useful-things-to-know-about-machine-learning">A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning</h2>
<p>For this first Research Minute, I chose the paper <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf">A Few Useful Things to Know about Machine Learning</a> by Pedro Domingos from the University of Washington. This paper has some very practical thoughts on creating your machine learning models. Below are a few of the ones I found the most helpful.</p>
<h3 id="generalizing-of-the-model-is-what-matters-most">Generalizing of the model is what matters most</h3>
<p>This is the main reason you create a model, but often times you won't have any true test data from the wild to test on. Because of this it is recommended to split your data even before you do any pre-processing on it. <code>scikit-learn</code> has a very handy <code>test_train_split</code> method just for this purpose.</p>
<p>What we're trying to avoid is overfitting your model (which we explore a bit later in this post). An overfit model won't give you accurate results if you deploy it and it predicts with real data that it hasn't seen before when the model was trained.</p>
<h3 id="you-need-more-than-just-data">You need more than just data</h3>
<p>The author puts this very nicely that doing machine learning is a lot of work. It's not magic that we just give it data and you're done. There's a lot more to it than that. A good analogy from the paper is that creating machine learning models is like farming. Nature does a good bit of the work, but a lot of up-front work has to be done for nature to do its thing. It's the same way with creating machine learning models - a lot of pre-processing and business understanding of the data is needed before starting the modeling process.</p>
<p>It's often said that most of the work in data science and machine learning is cleaning and getting your data in a state that you can feed it into a model and also to evaluate how your model's performance does. Fitting data into a model is easy with the current libraries. </p>
<h3 id="be-aware-of-overfitting">Be aware of overfitting</h3>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overfitting">Overfitting</a> a model is where the model will score high on training data, but when it sees real data that it hasn't yet seen, it will score low. Ways in which overfitting happens is with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bias–variance_tradeoff">bias and variance</a>. </p>
<p>Bias is where the algorithm learns the same wrong thing, which results in the model missing relevant relationships. Recall my <a href="https://dotnetmeditations.com/blog/2018/2/4/bias-in-machine-learning">previous post</a> about how bias in machine learning is a big topic that we still need to work on. Variance is where the model is sensitive to irrelevant data which can cause it to model random noise in the training data. </p>
<p>A popular way to battle against overfitting is to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-validation_(statistics">cross validation</a>) on your model. Cross validation will take your data and create subsets of it. In each subset it will take a random portion of the data as test data. It does this with each iteration, or fold, and it compares each score of the sampled test data of all iterations. This is a good way to test your model on different data to make sure you get consistent scores. If you don't, then your model may be sensitive to part of the data.</p>
<p>The image below from the article helps explain bias vs. variance through the game of darts.</p>

<h3 id="prioritize-feature-engineering">Prioritize feature engineering</h3>
<p>Sometimes the best way to get a more accurate model is to do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_engineering">feature engineering</a> on your data. This combines or manipulates columns of your data to create columns of new or a different type of data which may be better for the algorithm to detect a pattern. The author states in this paper that feature engineering is the best thing you can do to increase the accuracy of your model. Though, it is a tough thing to learn and there's <a href="http://amzn.to/2ETySNq">a book</a> strictly about feature engineering coming out soon.</p>
<p>Feature engineering is tricky. In the book mentioned above, doing feature engineering on your data is more like an art than it is a science. You have to know a lot about your data and have the creativity to think that unrelated parts of data can come together, or that one part of the data can be represented in a different way.</p>
<h3 id="more-data-over-a-more-complex-algorithm">More data over a more complex algorithm</h3>
<p>The author points out here in the paper that there can be a tradeoff of three elements when training a model - the amount of data, computational power, and the time it takes to train athe model. The author then goes into how the most important of those three is the time. Since time is a resource we can never get back or improve upon, unless we can invent the time machine, we need to choose algorithms that generalize well to our data as well as being able to be trained quickly. The best way to get both is to use more data with the simplest algorithm possible.</p>
<p>Wouldn't more complex algorithms generalize better than simpler algorithms? Not necessarily. Take a look at the below image from the paper. Multiple algorithms, some more complex than the others, still can generalize the same as the simpler algorithms. However, these simpler algorithms can be much faster to train and predict on new data.</p>

<hr /><p>The paper has several more ideas, thirteen in total, but these are the ones I thought gave the most insights from the projects I've done. I'm sure I'll come back to this paper several times as I do more projects and gain more machine learning experience.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Data Anonymization</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/4/10/data-anonymization</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With all the news about the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html">Cambridge Analytica scandal</a> that has happened, there's a lot of critical discussions going on about data privacy. With that, I've found a few resources that can help us as data scientists with data anonymation and privacy.</p>
<p>The first one is a video by <a href="https://research.zalando.com/welcome/team/katharina-rasch/">Katharina Rasch</a> who goes over some tips on how we can anonymize data better. </p>

<p>Another resource comes from Microsoft. They have a <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/ethics-and-law-in-analytics-and-ai">course in data ethics and law</a>. An interesting offering for a program about artificial intelligence, but an important one. </p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Using CNTK as a Backend for Keras</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/4/16/using-cntk-as-a-backend-for-keras</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I've been learning about <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras</a> through the <a href="https://amzn.to/2IWLC6z">Deep Learning with Python book</a> (which I'll be doing a review of), and it can be a bit tricker to get started than just running a single <code>pip</code> command to install a package.</p>




 
   <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Deep-Learning-Python-Francois-Chollet/dp/1617294438/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&linkCode=li2&tag=dotnetmeditat-20&linkId=71695a08234a901959ca949597651a8b" target="_blank"><img border="0" src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=1617294438&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=dotnetmeditat-20" ></a><img src="https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=dotnetmeditat-20&l=li2&o=1&a=1617294438" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
 

<p>First make sure you have Keras and CNTK installed.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-python">pip install keras
pip install cntk</code></pre>
<p>You may see documentation about installing CNTK by using the wheel, but since March, 2018 it is now on <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cntk/">PyPI</a> so you can directly install it like above.</p>
<p>The easiest way to change it is to go to your user home folder and navigate to the <code>.keras</code> folder. There you'll see a <code>keras.json</code> file. This file has some configurations for Keras to use when running.</p>
<pre><code>{
    "floatx": "float32",
    "epsilon": 1e-07,
    "backend": "tensorflow",
    "image_data_format": "channels_last"
}</code></pre><p>You can change the <code>backend</code> property to <code>cntk</code> and then next time you run Keras it will use it.</p>
<pre><code>Using CNTK backend
C:\Users\chron\Anaconda3\lib\site-packages\keras\backend\cntk_backend.py:21: UserWarning: CNTK backend warning: GPU is not detected. CNTK's CPU version is not fully optimized,please run with GPU to get better performance.
  'CNTK backend warning: GPU is not detected. '</code></pre>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>New Podcast</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/4/30/new-podcast</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just wanted to quickly mention that I'm attempting to start a new podcast. While it won't be very long (mostly less than 15 minutes an episode) and will probably won't come out, at the least, each month, I thought it would be nice to have a show that goes over some of the news at Microsoft that details data and artificial intelligence. So, without further ado, here's <a href="https://jonwood.co/azure-data-and-ai-podcast/2018/4/28/episode-1">Episode 1</a>.</p>

      <title>Top 5 Artificial Intelligence Sessions at Build 2018</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/5/27/top-5-ai-and-machine-learning-session-at-build-2018</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>During the same week <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2018/">PyCon</a> was going on, Microsoft had their annual <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/build">Build conference</a>. If you're not familiar with this conference this is where Microsoft announces a lot of new things for developers. The main focus of this year's Build was about artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Also in the same way as PyCon, Microsoft records all of the sessions at Build so we're free to watch them later. With that, I present to you what I think are the top five session at Build that go over artificial intelligence. Why top five instead of top ten like in the <a href="https://jonwood.co/blog/2018/5/27/top-5-session-at-pycon-2018">PyCon session post</a>? Well, there just wasn't enough to do a top ten. :)</p>
<h2 id="10-things-developers-need-to-know-about-building-intelligent-apps-by-noelle-lacharite">10 Things Developers Need to Know about Building Intelligent Apps by Noelle LaCharite</h2>
<p>This session goes a lot into the Cognitive Services. Not only how much it can improve your applications by incorporating them, but also how easy they are to implement.</p>

<h2 id="the-microsoft-ai-platform-a-state-of-the-union-by-joseph-sirosh">The Microsoft AI platform: a State of the Union by Joseph Sirosh</h2>
<p>Continuing with more information about Cognitive Services, this session goes into some of the other capabilities that were announced at Build. A nice demo they showed went over what they did with the released <a href="https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/release">JFK files</a> and how they used <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/announcing-cognitive-search-azure-search-cognitive-capabilities/">Cognitive Search</a> to analyze all of that data.</p>

<h2 id="devops-for-ai-deploying-everywhere-by-paige-bailey">DevOps for AI : Deploying everywhere by Paige Bailey</h2>
<p>This is an interesting talk that goes into the basics of data science and machine learning, but also goes into how to integrate the mindset of DevOps into data science. Doing so can help with things like testing and version control as a process to doing data science which can help reproducability and putting models into production.</p>

<h2 id="microsoft-ai-overview-for-developers-by-harry-shum">Microsoft AI overview for developers by Harry Shum</h2>
<p>This video is full of great demos that show off the power of several <a href="https://jonwood.co/blog/2018/5/5/an-overview-of-microsoft-cognitive-services">Cognitive Services</a>. Although, my favorite demo is the one where they show the power of having a bot on your site.</p>




 
   <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/MfBPmonJExk?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">

<h2 id="demystifying-machine-and-deep-learning-for-developers-by-seth-juarez-and-chris-lauren">Demystifying Machine and Deep Learning for Developers by Seth Juarez and Chris Lauren</h2>
<p>There are quite a few deep learning videos out there, but I firmly believe that this is one of the best. The way that Seth and Chris describe the deep learning process of the neural network algorithms makes it very understandable to what's going on behind the scenes when you train a model.</p>

<hr /><p>So a lot of interesting things happened at build in terms of AI, mostly involving their Cognitive Services APIs. These APIs, I think, are going to really help make your apps stand out from the rest of the crowd and Microsoft looks to continue to add to them with APIs from their <a href="https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/">Cognitive Services Labs</a>.</p>
<p>I'm definitely looking forward to what else they come up with.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Top 10 Sessions at PyCon 2018</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/5/27/top-5-session-at-pycon-2018</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://us.pycon.org/2018/">PyCon</a> has a very nice history of releasing videos of all of their sessions in a very timely manner. Although, it's up to me to actually have time to watch them.</p>
<p>Now that I've gone through several videos I wanted to share the top ten of them that I think will give the most to people who are interested in which sessions they should watch.</p>
<h2 id="python-2-to-3-how-to-upgrade-and-what-features-to-start-using-by-trey-hunner">Python 2 to 3: How to Upgrade and What Features to Start Using by Trey Hunner</h2>
<p>With the announcement of Python 2 coming to a <a href="https://pythonclock.org/">complete end</a> in the very beginning of 2020, it's a good idea to start thinking of how to upgrade your existing Python 2 code to Python 3. Trey gives a great talk on ways you can start upgrading and the best features of Python 3 you can start using.</p>

<h2 id="building-a-cross-platform-native-app-with-beeware-by-russell-keith-magee">Building a cross-platform native app with BeeWare by Russell Keith-Magee</h2>
<p>This was a cool one to watch. Using <a href="https://pybee.org/">BeeWare</a> we were able to see Russell show how to create, not only desktop applications, but mobile applications. This is pretty big because Python isn't known for creating mobile applications, but now that we have BeeWare perhaps it's time that it is.</p>

<h2 id="learning-from-failure-post-mortems-by-alex-gaynor">Learning From Failure: Post Mortems by Alex Gaynor</h2>
<p>You often learn best from failure. In this talk Alex goes over that failure happens and you have to learn from it. He then goes into that one of the best ways to do that is by writting a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Postmortem_documentation">post mortem</a> of the project which can serve as documentation and allow others who weren't part of the project learn from it as well.</p>

      <title>An Overview of Microsoft Cognitive Services</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/5/5/an-overview-of-microsoft-cognitive-services</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A big thing around apps these days are that they are much more intelligent than they used to be. And with that users are expecting more and more from apps. Usually, the way to do this is to create machine learning or deep learning models yourself and deploy that within your applications. But now, Microsoft can do the heavy lifting for you with their suite of <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/">Cognitive Services</a>.</p><p>These services can do everything you need from sentiment analysis on text to face and emotion detection. In this post, we'll go over each service that is provided so you can see what all is available and decide which one is best for your application.</p><p>Cognitive Services are divided up into several areas:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/vision/">Vision</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/speech/">Speech</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/know/">Knowledge</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/search/">Search</a></li>
<li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/directory/lang/">Language</a></li>
</ul><p>There's also a separate experimental area, called <a href="https://labs.cognitive.microsoft.com/">Cognitive Service Labs</a>, where Microsoft puts newer services out for people to try and give feedback on so they can improve on them. Let's take a deeper dive into each of these services and what they offer.</p><h2 id="vision">Vision</h2><h3 id="computer-vision">Computer Vision</h3><p>Perhaps one of the first of the cognitive services, the Computer Vision API does quite a lot. It can give you the following:</p><ul>
<li>Text description of what it thinks is happening in a photo</li>
<li>Tags of what it thinks it finds in a photo</li>
<li>Content moderator scores in terms of adult content</li>
<li>How it best things to categorize the photo</li>
<li>And if it recognizes any faces within the photo such as any celebrities</li>
</ul><p>That's a lot for one API to return and some of these things, such as the faces and content moderator, are their own API that you can implement separately.</p><h3 id="content-moderator">Content Moderator</h3><p>Do you have a site where people can upload images and videos but don't want to go through each upload to make sure there's no adult content? This API will do all of that for you.</p><p>The API can look at images to detect if it has a high confidence that it is adult content, but it can also detect if the image is racy. That is, if it is midly sexual but not considered adult. It's no limited to just images, though. It can also do these checks with video.</p><p>This can also look at text to see if there is any profanity in it. But it goes beyond just profanity. It can also help check if there is any personal identifiable information (PII) in the text to make sure no personal information is published to your site. In these times of digital privacy being even more important, this is going to be very helpful.</p><h3 id="face-api">Face API</h3><p>The Face API lets you do a few things in terms of finding and identifying people based on their face in a photo. This includes verifying faces from two photos match, recognizing emotion from a person's face, and detecting faces in a photo.</p><p>The emotion detection is interesting in that the API response will give you scores and the highest scored emotion is the one it thinks the face is giving.</p><pre><code>"scores": {
      "anger": 0.09557262,
      "contempt": 0.003917685,
      "disgust": 0.684764564,
      "fear": 4.03712329E-06,
      "happiness": 8.999826E-08,
      "neutral": 0.002147009,
      "sadness": 0.213587672,
      "surprise": 6.34691469E-06
    }</code></pre><p>In this response, "disgust" was the highest with a score of almost 70%.</p><h3 id="video-indexer">Video Indexer</h3><p>The Video Indexer API is really interesting. It combines a few of the other APIs including content moderation, speech, and sentiment analysis to give a complete look at a video. For a complete walkthrough at what it can do, I have a <a href="https://www.wintellect.com/get-insights-video-microsoft-video-indexer/">Wintellect post</a> that details the video indexer.</p><h3 id="custom-vision">Custom Vision</h3><p>The Customer Vision API is where you get to upload your own sets of images,  tag them, and then train a model to classify those images into the tags. This is a lot more powerful than just using the regular Computer Vision API where you can use your own images to train a model. This gives you or your business a more specialized model that is much easier to train and deploy than doing it by hand.</p><h2 id="speech">Speech</h2><h3 id="speech-to-text-and-text-to-speech">Speech to Text and Text to Speech</h3><p>These are similar and are mostly self explanatory, but there are some subtlties that Microsoft gives you with them. For instance, the APIs can be customized to detect specific vocabularies and accents for a more accurate detection of the speech.  </p><h3 id="speaker-recognition">Speaker Recognition</h3><p>This API can recognize who is speaking of an unknown speaker and gives you the speaker's name. This works by sending in different recordings of a person's voice and associating them with that voice. Then the API knows how to recognize their voice and it works quite well.</p><p>This API can also do speaker verification. Similar to enrolling the voice for recognition, you'd have to train the API to know who is speaking so it can recognize the voice.</p><h3 id="speech-translation">Speech Translation</h3><p>A fairly simple API but a powerful one. This adds real time and multi-language translation to speech in your apps. So if your application needs to support this type of feature, then just implement this API instead of spending the resources to create this model on your own, which may not even be as accurate as Microsoft's.</p><h2 id="knowledge">Knowledge</h2><h3 id="qna-maker">QnA Maker</h3><p>This API is unique and serves to solve a specific problem - can automate responses to commonly asked questions about my site or services? QnA Maker makes this really easy by having a web interface where you can put the questions and their answers in and then train a model to detect the question being asked and output the correct answer to it.</p><p>This API is mainly used in conjunction with other services, specifically LUIS, that will be highlighted in the language section, and the <a href="https://dev.botframework.com/">Bot Framework</a> to create bot to answer those types of questions for your users.</p><h3 id="custom-decision-service">Custom Decision Service</h3><p>This API is a newer offering and is still in preview, but is also one to look out for. It is a way to offer custom recommendations on certain items. Not only that, but it does this in real time through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning">reinforcement learning</a>.</p><h2 id="search">Search</h2><h3 id="bing-web-search">Bing Web Search</h3><p>This simple yet powerful API gives your applications the ability to search the web through a keyword. The API brings back search results of web pages, images, video, and even news with a single API call.</p><h3 id="bing-visual-search">Bing Visual Search</h3><p>This API allows you to search with an image and it will return any results that match that image. For example, if a customer wants to purchase a similar couch to replace their current one, your application can give results based off of a photo of their couch that they take and give product recommendations based on the results.</p><h3 id="bing-entity-search">Bing Entity Search</h3><p>This API can give some extra context about people, places, and things that your application may refer to based off what is available out on the web about them. As an example, suppose your application gives recommendations on local places to visit depending on where your user is. With this API you can give more context about the items that your application finds to your user so they can make a more informed decision on where to go or what to do next.</p><h3 id="bing-video-search">Bing Video Search</h3><p>This video search API does the same thing as the web search API, but it only returns videos. However, this API gives a lot more in the results than just links to videos; you also get information such as the embed HTML, view count, and video length for starters. This is a perfect API if your application content is all about videos from around the web.</p><h3 id="bing-news-search">Bing News Search</h3><p>Another specific API, this one returns news articles. Similar to the Video Search API, this one returns a lot of additional information you can use within your application. For instance, along with the news article URL, you get the date it was created, related news and categories to the current news article, and specific mentions within the article.</p><h3 id="bing-image-search">Bing Image Search</h3><p>You can't have specific search on news and videos without having one that's for images. Not only does this API give you the full URL to the image, but you also get metadata on each image, thumbnails, and information on the website that published the image.</p><h3 id="bing-custom-search">Bing Custom Search</h3><p>While the other search APIs are for the entire web, the Custom Search API will allow you to have search capabilities on your own custom domain. This means that search results will only be relevant to your domain and nothing else unless you specify other web pages to include. An example for this API can be if you have a huge knowledge base of FAQ on your site about all the products your company uses, then incorporating the Custom Search API will let users search through the entire knowledge base so they can quickly find an answer instead of browsing through all of the content.</p><h3 id="bing-autosuggest">Bing Autosuggest</h3><p>This is a unique API in all it does is, as you type in a search box, the API gets called giving suggestions on what it thinks you're typing. You've seen this if you've done a Google search, but to help illustrate, and see some results this API gives, here's a gif:</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1527253112724-VH1NXOGUKMKGJRWIELPY/autosuggest.gif?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="language">Language</h2><h3 id="text-analytics">Text Analytics</h3><p>This API is probably the most essential when you want to get information from text. That's due to what all this API gives you. You get <a href="">sentiment analysis</a>, it detects what language the text is in, and it extracts key phrases. </p><p>The API has actually been updated to also include a way to identify entities within the text. What this gives you is a way to tell if the text refers to a specific place, person, or organization.</p>

<h3 id="bing-spell-check">Bing Spell Check</h3><p>Another interesting API offering, the Spell Check API will analyze your text and give any suggestions on what it thinks should be fixed. </p><p>For instance, if I give the API the text of <code>He has fixed there enviornment</code>, it will come back with the following JSON:</p><pre><code>{
  "_type": "SpellCheck",
  "flaggedTokens": [
    {
      "offset": 13,

        },
        {
          "suggestion": "the",
          "score": 0.702565790712439
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "offset": 19,

Since it is REST based, there are an endless amount of applications for this API, such as helping you to localize your applications, communication and messaging applications, or you can mix in the Vision API to read text from images and translate that to another language with this API, and use the Speech API to speak the translation out from your application.</p><h3 id="content-moderator">Content Moderator</h3><p>This simple API looks at images and video to determine if they have adult content in it. This is a very useful API to help you make sure no adult images get uploaded to your website if you have that feature.</p><p>This API also includes a flag in the response if the image or video is racy or not. If it is racy it isn't necessarily adult, but somewhat close to it. For example, this API may flag a photo as racy if it is of a person in a bathing suit.</p><h3 id="language-understanding">Language Understanding</h3><p>Language Understanding Intelligent Service, or LUIS, is a nice part of the Cognitive Services family that allows applications to understand natural language. I've also talked more in detail about LUIS in a <a href="https://www.wintellect.com/building-language-intelligent-apps-microsofts-luis/">Wintellect post</a> as well as how to <a href="https://www.wintellect.com/integrating-microsoft-luis-bot-framework/">integrate LUIS</a> into the bot framework.</p><h2 id="cognitive-service-labs">Cognitive Service Labs</h2><h3 id="gesture">Gesture</h3><p>This API allows you to implement custom gestures into your application. And by gestures, it lets you implement hand gestures. Using hand gestures in your application can allow your users to be more productive and your applications be more intuitive to use.</p>

<h3 id="ink-analysis">Ink Analysis</h3><p>Ink Analysis allows you to not just allow a user to use a digital pen within your application, but it can understand what they wrote so you can take action on it.</p><p>This API can understand several things, such as:</p><ul>
<li>Shapes</li>
<li>Handwritten text in over 60 languages</li>
<li>Layout of text</li>
</ul><h3 id="local-insights">Local Insights</h3><p>This fairly simple API can give you scores on locations around you by the different types of aminities that those places have. You can also tell it to score based on the proximity to you, or by other custom criteria. </p><h3 id="event-tracking">Event Tracking</h3><p>This simple API will return events based off of a Wikipedia entry. For example, if I give a query of "Microsoft" I'll get a response like the below:</p><pre><code>{

It does this by recognizing entities with search queries to determine what the query is about and allows your users to get quicker answers.</p><h3 id="personality-chat">Personality Chat</h3><p>This will easily enable your bots to have more small talk, or conversation about unimportant subjects. Specifically, Personality Chat can add the following:</p><ul>
<li>Remove fallback answers such as "I don't know", or "I didn't get that".</li>
<li>Add personality to the small talk.</li>
<li>Add customizable small talk responses.</li>

      <title>Getting Started with FloydHub</title>
      <link>/blog/2018/8/27/getting-started-with-floydhub</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Deep learning training, especially if you have image data, can take a long time on a machine with only a CPU. But with advances in cloud computing you can move that training to the cloud on a machine that does have a GPU for relatively cheap cost.</p>
<p>In this video I introduce how to use FloydHub, which is one of those cloud services that allows the use of using a GPU.</p>

      <title>ML.NET End-to-End: Build Model from Database Data</title>
      <link>/blog/2019/3/17/mlnet-end-to-end-build-model-from-database-data</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When doing machine learning on your own data instead of data downloaded from the internet, you'll often have it stored on a database. In this post, I'll show how to use an Azure SQL database to write and read data then use that data to build an ML.NET machine learning model. I'll also show how to save the model into an Azure Blob Storage container so other applications can use it.</p><p>The code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/jwood803/MLNet-EndToEnd/blob/master/WineRegressionModel/Program.cs">GitHub</a>. For a video going over the code, check below.</p>

<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2><p>The data used will be the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rajyellow46/wine-quality">wine quality data</a> that's on Kaggle. This has several qualities of wine such as its Ph, sugar content, and whether the wine is red or white.</p>

<p>The label column will be "Quality". So we will use the other characteristics of wine to predict this value, which will be from 1 to 10.</p>
<h1 id="setup">Setup</h1>
<h2 id="creating-azure-resources">Creating Azure Resources</h2>
<p>For a database and a place to store the model file for other code, such as an API, can read from, we'll be using Azure.</p>

<p>In the new page, fill in the required information. If creating a new SQL Server to hold the database into, keep track of the username and password you use to fill it out as it will be needed to connect to it later. Click <code>Review + Create</code> and, if validations pass, click <code>Create</code>.</p>

<h3 id="creating-database-table">Creating Database Table</h3><p>Before we can start writing to the database, the table we'll be writting to needs to be created. You can use Azure Data Studio, which is a light weight version of SQL Server Management Studio, to connect to the database earlier using the user and password and then use the below script to create the table. The script just has columns corresponding to the columns in the data file with an added ID primary key column.</p><pre><code>CREATE TABLE dbo.WineData
(
    ID int NOT NULL IDENTITY,
    Type varchar(10) not null,
    FixedAcidity FLOAT not null,
    VolatileAcidity FLOAT not null,
    CitricAcid FLOAT not null,
    ResidualSugar FLOAT not null,
    Chlorides FLOAT not null,
    FreeSulferDioxide FLOAT not null,
    TotalSulfurDioxide FLOAT not null,
    Density FLOAT not null,
    Ph FLOAT not null,
    Sulphates FLOAT not null,
    Alcohol FLOAT not null,
    Quality FLOAT not null
)</code></pre><h1 id="code">Code</h1><p>The code will be done in a .NET Core Console project in Visual Studio 2017.</p><h2 id="nuget-packages">NuGet Packages</h2><p>Before we can really get started the following NuGet packages need to be installed:</p><ul>
<li>Microsoft.ML</li>
<li>Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration</li>
<li>Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json</li>
<li>System.Data.SqlClient</li>
<li>WindowsAzure.Storage</li>
</ul><h2 id="config-file">Config File</h2><p>In order to use the database and Azure Blob Storage we just created, we will have a config JSON file instead of hard coding our connection strings. The config file will look like this:</p><pre><code>{
  "sqlConnectionString": "&lt;SQL Connection String&gt;",
  "blobConnectionString": "&lt;Blob Connection String&gt;"
}</code></pre><p>Also, don't forget to mark this file to copy in its properties.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553679359361-SO9DGUN5DR9KO3I0AZNQ/2019-03-27+05_33_19-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>The connection strings can be obtained on the resources in the Azure Portal. For the SQL database connection string, go to the <code>Connection strings</code> section and you can copy the connection string from there.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553679604299-JRAFUJC5Q4ITPH3Y6M8C/2019-03-27+05_39_25-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>You will need to update the connection string with the username and password that you used when creating the SQL server.</p>
<p>For the Azure Blob Storage connection string, go to the <code>Access keys</code> section and there will be a key that can be used to connect to the storage account and under that will be the connection string.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1553679968417-TLGR01VUKEAFZIS0WY81/2019-03-27+05_44_49-Clipboard.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="writing-to-database">Writing to Database</h2><p>Since we just created the SQL server, database, and table, we need to add the data to it. Since we have the <code>System.Data.SqlClient</code> package, we can use <code>SqlConnection</code> to connect to the database. Note that, an ORM like Entity Framework can be used instead of the methods from the <code>System.Data.SqlClient</code> package.</p><p>Real quick, though, let's set up by adding a couple of fields on the class. One to hold the SQL connection string and another to have a constant string of the file name for the model we will create.</p><pre><code>private static string _sqlConectionString;
private static readonly string fileName = "wine.zip";</code></pre><p>Next, let's use the <code>ConfigurationBuilder</code> to build the configuration object and to allow us to read in the config file values.</p><pre><code>var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .AddJsonFile("config.json");

var configuration = builder.Build();</code></pre><p>With the configuration built, we can use it to pull out the SQL connection string and assign it to the field created earlier.</p><pre><code>_sqlConectionString = configuration["connectionString"];</code></pre><p>To write the data into the database we need to read in from the file. I put the file in the solution and make sure it can be read using the same method as the config file to make sure it gets copied over.</p><p>Using LINQ, we can read from the file and parse out each of the columns into a <code>WineData</code> object. </p><pre><code>var items = File.ReadAllLines("./winequality.csv")
    .Skip(1)
    .Select(line =&gt; line.Split(","))
    .Select(i =&gt; new WineData
    {
        Type = i[0],
        FixedAcidity = Parse(i[1]),
        VolatileAcidity = Parse(i[2]),
        CitricAcid = Parse(i[3]),
        ResidualSugar = Parse(i[4]),
        Chlorides = Parse(i[5]),
        FreeSulfurDioxide = Parse(i[6]),
        TotalSulfurDioxide = Parse(i[7]),
        Density = Parse(i[8]),
        Ph = Parse(i[9]),
        Sulphates = Parse(i[10]),
        Alcohol = Parse(i[11]),
        Quality = Parse(i[12])
    });</code></pre><p>The <code>WineData</code> class holds all of the fields that are in the data file.</p><pre><code>public class WineData
{
    public string Type;
    public float FixedAcidity;
    public float VolatileAcidity;
    public float CitricAcid;
    public float ResidualSugar;
    public float Chlorides;
    public float FreeSulfurDioxide;
    public float TotalSulfurDioxide;
    public float Density;
    public float Ph;
    public float Sulphates;
    public float Alcohol;
    public float Quality;
}</code></pre><p>There's an additional <code>Parse</code> method added to all but one of the fields. That's due to us getting back a string value of the data, but our class says it should be of type <code>float</code>. The <code>Parse</code> method is fairly straight forward in that it just tries to parse out the field and if it can't it uses the default value of <code>float</code>, which is 0.0.</p><pre><code>private static float Parse(string value)
{
    return float.TryParse(value, out float parsedValue) ? parsedValue : default(float);
}</code></pre><p>Now that we have the data, we can save it to the database. In a <code>using</code> statement, new up an instance of <code>SqlConnection</code> and pass in the connection string as the parameter. Inside here, we need to call the <code>Open</code> method of the connection and then create an insert statment. Then, loop over each item from the results of reading in the file and add each field from the item as parameters for the insert statement. After that, call the <code>ExecuteNonQuery</code> method to execute the query on the database.</p><pre><code>using (var connection = new SqlConnection(_sqlConectionString))
{
    connection.Open();

    var insertCommand = @"INSERT INTO dbo.WineData VALUES
        (@type, @fixedAcidity, @volatileAcidity, @citricAcid, @residualSugar, @chlorides,
         @freeSulfureDioxide, @totalSulfurDioxide, @density, @ph, @sulphates, @alcohol, @quality);";

    foreach (var item in items)
    {
        var command = new SqlCommand(insertCommand, connection);

        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@type", item.Type);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@fixedAcidity", item.FixedAcidity);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@volatileAcidity", item.VolatileAcidity);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@citricAcid", item.CitricAcid);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@residualSugar", item.ResidualSugar);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@chlorides", item.Chlorides);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@freeSulfureDioxide", item.FreeSulfurDioxide);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@totalSulfurDioxide", item.TotalSulfurDioxide);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@density", item.Density);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@ph", item.Ph);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@sulphates", item.Sulphates);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@alcohol", item.Alcohol);
        command.Parameters.AddWithValue("@quality", item.Quality);

        command.ExecuteNonQuery();
    }
}</code></pre><p>We can run this and check the database to make sure the data got added.</p>

<h3 id="reading-from-database">Reading from Database</h3>
<p>Now that we have data in our database let's read from it. This code will be similar than what we used to write to the database by using the <code>SqlConnection</code> class again. In fact, the only differences is the query we send to it and how we read in the data.</p>
<p>We do need a variable to add each row to, though, so we can create a new <code>List</code> of <code>WineData</code> objects. </p>
<pre><code>var data = new List&lt;WineData&gt;();</code></pre><p>Within the <code>SqlConnection</code> we can create a select statement that will return all of the columns and execute it with the <code>ExecuteReader</code> function. This returns a <code>SqlDataReader</code> object and we can use that to extract out the data.</p>
<p>In a <code>while</code> loop, which checks that the reader can read the next row, use the <code>List</code> variable created earlier to add a new instance of the <code>WineData</code> object to it and we can map from the reader to the object using the <code>reader.GetValue</code> method. The <code>GetValue</code> parameter will be the column position and then we'll do a <code>ToString</code> on it. Note that we need the <code>Parse</code> method from above again here to parse the strings into a <code>float</code>.</p>
<pre><code>using (var conn = new SqlConnection(_sqlConectionString))
{
    conn.Open();

    var selectCmd = "SELECT * FROM dbo.WineData";

    var sqlCommand = new SqlCommand(selectCmd, conn);

    var reader = sqlCommand.ExecuteReader();

    while (reader.Read())
    {
        data.Add(new WineData
        {
            Type = reader.GetValue(0).ToString(),
            FixedAcidity = Parse(reader.GetValue(1).ToString()),
            VolatileAcidity = Parse(reader.GetValue(2).ToString()),
            CitricAcid = Parse(reader.GetValue(3).ToString()),
            ResidualSugar = Parse(reader.GetValue(4).ToString()),
            Chlorides = Parse(reader.GetValue(5).ToString()),
            FreeSulfurDioxide = Parse(reader.GetValue(6).ToString()),
            TotalSulfurDioxide = Parse(reader.GetValue(7).ToString()),
            Density = Parse(reader.GetValue(8).ToString()),
            Ph = Parse(reader.GetValue(9).ToString()),
            Sulphates = Parse(reader.GetValue(10).ToString()),
            Alcohol = Parse(reader.GetValue(11).ToString()),
            Quality = Parse(reader.GetValue(12).ToString())
        });
    }
}</code></pre><h2 id="creating-the-model">Creating the Model</h2>
<p>Now that we have our data from the database, let's use it to create an ML.NET model.</p>
<p>First thing, though, let's create an instance of the <code>MLContext</code>.</p>
<pre><code>var context = new MLContext();</code></pre><p>We can use the <code>LoadFromEnumerable</code> helper method to load the <code>IEnumerable</code> data that we have into the <code>IDataView</code> that ML.NET uses. In previous versions of ML.NET this used to be called <code>ReadFromEnumerable</code>.</p>
<pre><code>var mlData = context.Data.LoadFromEnumerable(data);</code></pre><p>Now that we have the <code>IDataView</code> we can use that to split the data into a training set and test set. In previous versions of ML.NET this returned a tuple and it could be deconstructed into two variables (<code>var (trainSet, testSet) = ...</code>), but now it returns an object.</p>
<pre><code>var testTrainSplit = context.Regression.TrainTestSplit(mlData);</code></pre><p>With the data set up, we can create the pipeline. The two main things to do here is to set up the <code>Type</code> feature, which denotes if the wine is red or white, as <a href="https://hackernoon.com/what-is-one-hot-encoding-why-and-when-do-you-have-to-use-it-e3c6186d008f">one hot encoded</a>. Then we concatenate each of the other features into a feature array. We'll use the <code>FastTree</code> trainer and since our label column isn't named "Label", we set the <code>labelColumnName</code> parameter to the name of the label we want to predict, which is "Quality".</p>
<pre><code>var pipeline = context.Transforms.Categorical.OneHotEncoding("TypeOneHot", "Type")
                .Append(context.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "FixedAcidity", "VolatileAcidity", "CitricAcid",
                    "ResidualSugar", "Chlorides", "FreeSulfurDioxide", "TotalSulfurDioxide", "Density", "Ph", "Sulphates", "Alcohol"))
                .Append(context.Regression.Trainers.FastTree(labelColumnName: "Quality"));</code></pre><p>With the pipeline created, we can now call the <code>Fit</code> method on it with our training data.</p>
<pre><code>var model = pipeline.Fit(testTrainSplit.TrainSet);</code></pre><h3 id="save-model">Save Model</h3>
<p>With our new model, let's save it to Azure Blob Storage so we can retrieve it to build an API around the model.</p>
<p>To start, we'll use the connection string that we put in the config earlier. We then pass that into the <code>Parse</code> method of the <code>CloudStorageAccount</code> class.</p>
<pre><code>var storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(configuration["blobConnectionString"]);</code></pre><p>With a reference to the storage account, we can now use that to create a client and use the client to create a reference to the container that we will call "models". This container will need to be created in the storage account, as well.</p>
<pre><code>var client = storageAccount.CreateCloudBlobClient();
var container = client.GetContainerReference("models");</code></pre><p>With the container reference, we can create a blob reference to a file, which we created earlier as a field.</p>
<pre><code>var blob = container.GetBlockBlobReference(fileName);</code></pre><p>To save the model to a file, we can create a file stream using <code>File.Create</code> and inside the stream we can call the <code>context.Model.Save</code> method.</p>
<pre><code>using (var stream = File.Create(fileName))
{
    context.Model.Save(model, stream);
}</code></pre><p>And to upload the file to blob storage, just call the <code>UploadFromFileAsync</code> method. Note that this method is async, so we need to mark the containing method as <code>async</code> and add <code>await</code> in front of this method.</p>
<pre><code>await blob.UploadFromFileAsync(fileName);</code></pre><p>After running this, there should now be a file added to blob storage.</p>

<p>Hope this was helpful. In the next part of this end-to-end series, we will show how to create an API that will load the model from Azure Blob Storage and use it to make predictions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Clustering in ML.NET</title>
      <link>/blog/2019/3/2/clustering-in-mlnet</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Clustering is a well known type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm. It is unsupervised since there isn't usually a known label in the data to help the algorithm know how to train on a known value. Instead of training on the data point to see a pattern in how it got a label value, an unsupervised algorithm will find patterns among each of the data points themselves. In this post, I'll go over how to use the clustering trainer in ML.NET.</p><p>This example will be using ML.NET version 0.11. Sample code is on <a href="https://github.com/jwood803/MLNetExamples/tree/master/MLNetExamples/SeedClustering">GitHub</a>.</p><p>For a video version of this example, check out the video below.</p>

</iframe>
 

<h2 id="the-data">The Data</h2><p>The data I'll be using is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/dongeorge/seed-from-uci">wheat seed</a> data that can be found on Kaggle. This data has properties of wheat seeds such as area, perimeter, length and width of each seed, etc. These properties measure what variety of wheat the seed is. Whether it is the variety of Kama, Rosa, or Canadian.</p><h2 id="project-setup">Project Setup</h2><p>For the code, I'll create a new .NET Core Console project and bring in ML.NET as a NuGet package. For the data, I like to put them in the project itself so it can be easier to work with. When doing that, don't forget to mark the file to copy or copy if newer so it can be read when running the project.</p>

<h2 id="loading-data">Loading Data</h2>
<p>To start off, instantiate an instance of the <code>ML Context</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var context = new MLContext();</code></pre>
<p>To read in the data, use the <code>CreateTextLoader</code> method on the <code>context.Data</code> peroperty. This will take in an array of <code>TextLoader.Column</code> objects. In each of these object's constuctor pass in the name of the column, what data type it is which all of ours will be <code>DataKind.Single</code> to represent a float, and the position in the file where the column is. Then, as other parameters to the <code>CreateTextLoader</code> method, pass in that it has a header and that the separator is a comma.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var textLoader = context.Data.CreateTextLoader(new[]
{
    new TextLoader.Column("A", DataKind.Single, 0),
    new TextLoader.Column("P", DataKind.Single, 1),
    new TextLoader.Column("C", DataKind.Single, 2),
    new TextLoader.Column("LK", DataKind.Single, 3),
    new TextLoader.Column("WK", DataKind.Single, 4),
    new TextLoader.Column("A_Coef", DataKind.Single, 5),
    new TextLoader.Column("LKG", DataKind.Single, 6),
    new TextLoader.Column("Label", DataKind.Single, 7)
},
hasHeader: true,
separatorChar: ',');</code></pre>
<p>With our data schema defined we can use it to load in the data. This is done by calling the <code>Load</code> method on the loader we just created above and pass in the file location.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">IDataView data = textLoader.Load("./Seed_Data.csv");</code></pre>
<p>Now that the data is loaded let's use it to get a training and test set. We can do that with the <code>context.Clustering.TrainTestSplit</code> method. All this takes in is the <code>IDataView</code> that we got when we loaded in the data. Optionally, we can specify what fraction of the data to get for our test set.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var trainTestData = context.Clustering.TrainTestSplit(data, testFraction: 0.2);</code></pre>
<p>This returns an option that has <code>TrainSet</code> and <code>TestSet</code> properties.</p>
<h2 id="building-the-model">Building the Model</h2>
<p>Now that the data is loaded and we have our train and test data sets, let's now create the pipeline. We can start simple by creating a features vector and then passing that into a clustering algorithm of our choosing. Since all of the data are float columns there's no need to do any other processing to it.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var pipeline = context.Transforms.Concatenate("Features", "A", "P", "C", "LK", "WK", "A_Coef", "LKG")
    .Append(context.Clustering.Trainers.KMeans(featureColumnName: "Features", clustersCount: 3));</code></pre>
<p>Using the <code>context.Transforms</code> property we have access to several transformations we can perform on our data. The one we'll do here is the Concatenate transform. The first parameter is the name of the new column that it will create after concatenating the specified columns. The next parameter(s) are <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/params"><code>params</code></a> of all the columns to be concatenated.</p>
<p>Appended to the transform is the trainer, or algorithm, we want to use. In this case we'll use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering">K-Means</a> algorithm. The parameters here are the column name of all the features, which we specified in the Concatenate transform as "Features". This is actually defaulted to "Features" so we don't need to specify it. We can also define the number of clusters the algorithm should try to create.</p>
<p>To get a preview of the data so far, we can call the <code>Preview</code> method on any instance of <code>IDataView</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var preview = trainTestData.TrainSet.Preview();</code></pre>
<p>To create the model, we simply just call the <code>Fit</code> method on the pipeline and pass in the training set.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var model = pipeline.Fit(trainTestData.TrainSet);</code></pre>
<h2 id="evaluating-the-model">Evaluating the Model</h2>
<p>With a model built, we can now do a quick evaluation on the model. To do this for clustering, use the <code>context.Clustering.Evaluate</code> method. We can pass in the test data set. However, we would need to transform that data set similar to what we did in the pipeline. To do this we can use the <code>Transform</code> method on the model and pass in our test data set.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var predictions = model.Transform(trainTestData.TestSet);</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use the test data set to evaluate the model and give some metrics.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var metrics = context.Clustering.Evaluate(predictions);</code></pre>
<p>We get a few metrics for clustering on the <code>metrics</code> object but the one I'll care about is the average minimum score. This tells us the average distance from all examples to their center point of their cluster. So the lower the number here the better the clustering is. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">Console.WriteLine($"Average minimum score: {metrics.AvgMinScore}");</code></pre>
<h2 id="predicting-on-model">Predicting on Model</h2>
<p>To make a prediction on our model we first need to create a prediction engine. To do that, call the <code>CreatePredictionEngine</code> method on the model. This is generic and it does specify the data input schema and the prediction classes so it knows what object to read in for a new prediction and what object to use when it makes a prediction.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">public class SeedData
{
    public float A;
    public float P;
    public float C;
    public float LK;
    public float WK;
    public float A_Coef;
    public float LKG;
    public float Label;
}

public class SeedPrediction
{
    [ColumnName("PredictedLabel")]
    public uint SelectedClusterId;
    [ColumnName("Score")]
    public float[] Distance;
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>ColumnName</code> attribute tells the prediction engine what fields to use for those columns. This is under the <code>Microsoft.ML.Data</code> namespace.</p>
<p>To create the prediction engine, which used to be done using the <code>CreatePredictionFunction</code> method in previous versions of ML.NET, call it on the model and pass in the context as the parameter.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var predictionFunc = model.CreatePredictionEngine&lt;SeedData, SeedPrediction&gt;(context);</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use the prediction engine to make predictions. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">var prediction = predictionFunc.Predict(new SeedData
{
    A = 13.89F,
    P = 15.33F,
    C = 0.862F,
    LK = 5.42F,
    WK = 3.311F,
    A_Coef = 2.8F,
    LKG = 5
});</code></pre>
<p>And we can get the selected cluster ID, or what cluster the model predicts the data would belong to.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-csharp">Console.WriteLine($"Prediction - {prediction.SelectedClusterId}");</code></pre>

      <title>Top 5 YouTube Channels</title>
      <link>/blog/2019/4/17/top-5-youtube-channels</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>YouTube is a great resource to learn new development topics. It is one of my go to places if I want to learn a new topic or even to get into a specific area. However, there are a few channels that I make sure and check out if there are new videos.</p>

<h3 id="-traversy-media-https-www-youtube-com-channel-uc29ju8biph5as8ognqzwjya-"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC29ju8bIPH5as8OGnQzwJyA">Traversy Media</a></h3><p>One of my favorite channels, Brad really has some great content. Mostly going over web technologies he definitely goes over the big three frameworks - React, Angular, and Vue. However, he also goes over some pure CSS, HTML, and JavaScript in some of his videos. He also has videos that go over career and personal development issues that I find very helpful.</p><h3 id="-fireship-io-https-www-youtube-com-channel-ucsbjurrpoezykls9eqgamoa-"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsBjURrPoezykLs9EqgamOA">Fireship.io</a></h3><p>This channel used to be called Angular Fire and by the name you may guess what he covers - Angular and Firebase. However, he's branched out quite a bit into some other videos such as Flutter for mobile applications. He has some of the best <a href="https://www.learnrxjs.io/">RxJS</a> videos that I've found very helpful.</p><h3 id="-academind-https-www-youtube-com-channel-ucsjbgttlrdami-tdgpuv9-w-"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSJbGtTlrDami-tDGPUV9-w">Academind</a></h3><p>Maximilian Schwarzmüller is one of my favorite instructors for web based technologies. He has courses in all of the current popular frameworks - Angular, React, and Vue. He also has courses in some other technologies which may be useful to learn, such as Flutter and React Native for mobile applications and AWS for serverless applications.</p><h3 id="-corey-schafer-https-www-youtube-com-channel-uccezigc97pvuur4_gbfus5g-"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCezIgC97PvUuR4_gbFUs5g">Corey Schafer</a></h3><p>Corey's channel is probably the most popular in terms of Python content. He's got so many videos that whatever you need to do in Python he already has a video about it. Another great thing about this channel is that he also goes into other developer tools, such as bash and dot files which I just started watching, as well as git.</p><h3 id="-data-school-https-www-youtube-com-channel-ucnvzaplje2ljpzseqylseyg-"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnVzApLJE2ljPZSeQylSEyg">Data School</a></h3><p>The Data School channel is the best if you want to learn data wrangling and data cleaning with <a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">pandas</a> or machine learning with <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">scikit-learn</a>. You can tell he has a deep knowledge with both of these libraries.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>ML.NET Predictions on the Web in F# with the SAFE Stack</title>
      <link>/blog/2020/12/22/mlnet-predictions-on-the-web-in-f-with-the-safe-stack</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Building web sites in C# has be something that you could do for quitea while. But, did you know that you can do web sites in F#? Enter the SAFE Stack. An all-in-one framework that allows you to use F# on the server, but also allows you to use F# on the client side. That's right, no more JavaScript for the client side!</p><p>For a video version of this post, checkout the video below.</p>

<h2 id="introduction-to-the-safe-stack">Introduction to the SAFE Stack</h2><p>The SAFE Stack is built on top of these components:</p><ul>
<li>Saturn</li>
<li>Azure</li>
<li>Fable</li>
<li>Elmish</li>
</ul><p>Let's go into each of these in a bit more detail.</p><h3 id="saturn-"><a href="https://saturnframework.org/explanations/overview.html">Saturn </a></h3><p>Saturn is a backend framework built in F#. Saturn privides several parts to help us build web applications, such as the application lifecycle, a router, controllers, and views. </p><h3 id="azure"><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/">Azure</a></h3><p>Azure is Microsoft's cloud platform. This is mostly used for hosting our website and any other cloud resources that we may need, such as Azure Blob Storage for files or Azure Event Hub for real time streaming data. </p><h3 id="fable-"><a href="https://fable.io/">Fable </a></h3><p>Fable is a JavaScript compiler. Similar to how TypeScript compiles into JavaScript, Fable does the same, except that you write F# and it compiles into JavaScript. </p><h3 id="elmish"><a href="https://elmish.github.io/elmish/">Elmish</a></h3><p>The Elmish concept builds on top of Fable to provide a model-view-update pattern that is popularized in the Elm programming language. </p><h2 id="creating-a-project">Creating a Project</h2><p>The best way to create a SAFE Stack project is to follow the steps in the documentation, but I'll highlight them here. By the way, their documentation is great!</p><p>There is a .NET template created to make creating a SAFE project much easier than manually putting it together.</p><p>To install the template, run the below command.</p><p><code>dotnet new -i SAFE.Template</code></p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1608719860517-CKH0EEURD07E70A8DOZ7/1.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Once the template is installed, make a new directory to keep the project files.</p>
<p><code>mkdir MLNET_SAFE</code></p>
<p>Then, you can use the .NET CLI to create a new project from the template with another command and specify the name of the project. </p>
<p><code>dotnet new SAFE -n MLNET_SAFE</code></p>
<p>Once that finishes, run the command to restore the tools used for the project. Specifically, the FAKE tool, which is used to build and run the project.</p>
<p><code>dotnet tool restore</code></p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1608719952141-51FNBYN7RNWQM4O4VH08/2.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>With that done we can now run the app! To do that run the FAKE command with the run target.</p>
<p><code>dotnet fake build --target run</code></p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1608719983039-DTNRF712CKY6I758IRPA/3.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>This is going to perform the following steps (which can be found in the build.fsx file):</p>
<ul>
<li>Clean the solution</li>
<li>Run npm install to install client side dependencies</li>
<li>Compiles the projects</li>
<li>Run the projects in watch mode</li>
</ul>
<p>When that completes, you can navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a>. We now have a running instance of the SAFE Stack!</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1608720078219-OLIMZCHDEFRZBJNDSAL8/4.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>The template is a todo app which helps show different aspects of the SAFE Stack. Feel free to explore the app and the code before continuing.</p>
<h2 id="adding-ml-net">Adding ML.NET</h2>
<h3 id="the-model">The Model</h3>
<p>For the ML.NET model, I'll be using the salary model that was created in the below video. It's a simple model with a small dataset to go over more of the F# and ML.NET nuances than working with the data itself.</p>




 
   <iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/PVJMX-iD0no?wmode=opaque&amp;enablejsapi=1" height="480" width="854" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="">
</iframe>
 

<p>In the Server project, add a new folder called "MLModel". In there, we can add the model file that was generated from the above video. We would also need to update the properties on the file to allow it to output during build.</p>
<p>Note that this can easily be in Azure Blob Storage instead and use the SDK to retrieve and download it from there.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1608720257710-FK57M1PPI519USBQBX84/5.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Next, for the Server and Shared projects, add the Microsoft.ML NuGet packge. At this time, it's at version 1.5.4.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1608720293277-IS30HAXTZ60G2PW4UBIO/6.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  


<h2 id="updating-the-shared-file">Updating the Shared File</h2>
<p>Now we can update the file in the Shared project. We can put types and methods in this file that we know will be used in more than one other project. For our case, we can use the model input and output schemas.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type SalaryInput = {
    YearsExperience: float32
    Salary: float32
}

[&lt;CLIMutable&gt;]
type SalaryPrediction = {
    [&lt;ColumnName("Score")&gt;]
    PredictedSalary: float32
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>SalaryInput</code> class has two properties that are both of type <code>float32</code>. The <code>SalaryPrediction</code> class is special where we need to put the <code>CLIMutable</code> attribute on it. That has one property that's also of type <code>float32</code>. This property has the <code>ColumnName</code> attribute on it to map to the output column from the ML.NET model.</p>
<p>There's one other type we can add to our shared file. We can create an interface that has a method to get our predictions that can be called from the client to the server.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type ISalaryPrediction = { getSalaryPrediction: float32 -&gt; Async&lt;string&gt; }</code></pre>
<p>In this type, we create a method signature called <code>getSalaryPrediction</code> which takes in a paramter of type <code>float32</code> and it returns a type of Async of string. So this method is asynchornous and will return a string result.</p>
<h2 id="updating-the-server">Updating the Server</h2>
<p>Next, we can update our server file. This file contains the code to run the web server and any other methods that we may need to call from the client.</p>
<p>To run the web app you have the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let webApp =
    Remoting.createApi()
    |&gt; Remoting.withRouteBuilder Route.builder
    |&gt; Remoting.fromValue predictionApi
    |&gt; Remoting.buildHttpHandler

let app =
    application {
        url "http://0.0.0.0:8085"
        use_router webApp
        memory_cache
        use_static "public"
        use_gzip
    }

run app</code></pre>
<p>The <code>app</code> variable creates an application instance and sets some properties of the web app, such as what the URL is, what router to use, and to use GZip compression. You can also add items such as using OAuth, set logging, or enable CORS.</p>
<p>The <code>webApp</code> variable creates the API and builds the routing. Both of these are based on the <code>predictionApi</code> variable which is based off the <code>ISalaryPrediction</code> type we defined in the shared file.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let predictionApi = { getSalaryPrediction =
    fun yearsOfExperience -&gt; async {
        let prediction = prediction.PredictSalary yearsOfExperience
        match prediction with
        | p when p.PredictedSalary &gt; 0.0f -&gt; return p.PredictedSalary.ToString("C")
        | _ -&gt; return "0"
    } }</code></pre>
<p>The API has the one method we defined in the interface - <code>getSalaryPrediction</code>. This is where we implement that interface method. It takes in a variable, <code>yearsOfExperience</code>, and it runs an async method defined by the <code>async</code> keyword. In the brackets is what it should run. </p>
<p>All we are running in there is to use a prediction variable to call the PredictSalary method on it and pass in the years of experience variable to it. With the value from that we do a match expression and if the PredictedSalary property is greater than 0 we return that property formatted as a currency. If it is 0 or below, we just return the string "0".</p>
<p>But where did the prediction variable come from? Just above the API implementation, a new Prediction type is created.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type Prediction () =
    let context = MLContext()

    let (model, _) = context.Model.Load("./MLModel/salary-model.zip")

    let predictionEngine = context.Model.CreatePredictionEngine&lt;SalaryInput, SalaryPrediction&gt;(model)

    member __.PredictSalary yearsOfExperience =
        let predictedSalary = predictionEngine.Predict { YearsExperience = yearsOfExperience; Salary = 0.0f }

        predictedSalary</code></pre>
<p>This creates the instance of the <code>MLContext</code>. It also loads in the model file, and creates a <code>PredictionEngine</code> instance from the model. Remember the <code>SalaryInput</code> and <code>SalaryPrediction</code> types are from the shared project. And notice that, when we load from the model, it returns a tuple. The first value returns the model whereas the second value returns the <code>DataViewSchema</code>. Since we don't need the <code>DataViewSchema</code> in our case, we can ignore it using an underscore (<code>_</code>) for that variable.</p>
<p>This type also creates a member method called <code>PredictSalary</code>. This is where we call the <code>predictionEngine.Predict</code> method and give it an instance of <code>SalaryInput</code>. Because F# is really good at inferring types, we can just give it the <code>YearsExperience</code> property and it knows that it is the <code>SalaryInput</code> type. We do need to supply the <code>Salary</code> property as well, but we can just set that to 0.0. Then, we return the predicted salary from this method. In F# we don't need to specify the <code>return</code> keyword. It automatically returns if it's the last item in the method.</p>
<h3 id="updating-the-client">Updating the Client</h3>
<p>With the server updated to do what we need, we can now update the client to use the new information. Everything we need to update will be in the <code>Index.fs</code> file.</p>
<p>There are a few Todo items that it's trying to use here from the Shared project. We'll have to update these to use our new types.</p>
<p>First, we have the <code>Model</code> type. This is the state of our client side information. For the Todo application, it has two properties, <code>Todos</code> and <code>Input</code>. The <code>Input</code> property is the current input in the text box and the <code>Todos</code> property are the currently displayed Todos. So to update this we can change the <code>Todos</code> property to be <code>PredictedSalary</code> to indicate the currently predicted salary from the input of the years of experience. This property would need to be of type <code>string</code>. </p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type Model =
    { Input: string
      PredictedSalary: string }</code></pre>
<p>The next part to update is the <code>Msg</code> type. This represents the different events that can update the state of your application. For todos, that can be adding a new todo or getting all of the todos. For our application we will keep the <code>SetInput</code> message to get the value of our input text box. We will remove the others and add two - <code>PredictSalary</code> and <code>PredictedSalary</code>. The <code>PredictSalary</code> message will initiate the call to the server to get the predicted salary from our model, and the <code>PredictedSalary</code> message will initiate when we got a new salary from the model so we can update our UI.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">type Msg =
    | SetInput of string
    | PredictSalary
    | PredictedSalary of string</code></pre>
<p>For the <code>todosApi</code> we simply rename it to <code>predictionApi</code> and change it to use the <code>ISalaryPrediction</code> instead of the <code>ITodosApi</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let predictionApi =
    Remoting.createApi()
    |&gt; Remoting.withRouteBuilder Route.builder
    |&gt; Remoting.buildProxy&lt;ISalaryPrediction&gt;</code></pre>
<p>The <code>init</code> method can be updated to use our updated model. So instead of having an array of Todos we just have a string of <code>PredictedSalary</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let init(): Model * Cmd&lt;Msg&gt; =
    let model =
        { Input = ""
          PredictedSalary = "" }
    model, Cmd.none</code></pre>
<p>Next, we update the <code>update</code> method. This takes in a message and will perform the work depending on what the message is. For the Todos app, if the message comes in as <code>AddTodo</code> it will then call the <code>todosApi.addTodo</code> method to add the todo to the in-memory storage. In our app, we will keep the <code>SetInput</code> message and add two more to match what we added in our Msg type from above. The <code>PredictSalary</code> message will convert the input from a string to a <code>float32</code> and pass that into the <code>predictionApi.getSalaryPrediction</code> method. The <code>PredictedSalary</code> message will then update our current model with the new salary.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">let update (msg: Msg) (model: Model): Model * Cmd&lt;Msg&gt; =
    match msg with
    | SetInput value -&gt;
        { model with Input = value }, Cmd.none
    | PredictSalary -&gt;
        let salary = float32 model.Input
        let cmd = Cmd.OfAsync.perform predictionApi.getSalaryPrediction salary PredictedSalary
        { model with Input = "" }, cmd
    | PredictedSalary newSalary -&gt;
        { model with PredictedSalary = newSalary }, Cmd.none</code></pre>
<p>The last thing to update here is in the <code>containerBox</code> method. This builds up the UI. You may have already noticed that there is no HTML in our solution anywhere. That's because Fable is using React behind the scenes and we are able to write the HTML in F#. We'll keep the majority of the UI so there's only a few items to update. The content is what's currently holding the list of todos in the current app. For our case, however, we want it to show the predicted salary so we'll remove the ordered list and replace it with the below div. This sets a label and, if the <code>model.PredictedSalary</code> is empty it doesn't display anything. But if it isn't empty it does a formatted string containg the predicted salary.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">div [ ] [ label [ ] [ if not (System.String.IsNullOrWhiteSpace model.PredictedSalary) then sprintf "Predicted salary: %s" model.PredictedSalary |&gt; str ]]</code></pre>
<p>Next, we just need to update the placeholder in the text box to match what we would like the user to do.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">Control.p [ Control.IsExpanded ] [
                Input.text [
                  Input.Value model.Input
                  Input.Placeholder "How many years of experience?"
                  Input.OnChange (fun x -&gt; SetInput x.Value |&gt; dispatch) ]
            ]</code></pre>
<p>And with the button we just need to tell it to dispatch, or fire off a message, to the <code>PredictSalary</code> message.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-fsharp">Button.a [
   Button.Color IsPrimary
   Button.OnClick (fun _ -&gt; dispatch PredictSalary)
]</code></pre>
<p>With all of those updates we can now run the app again to see how it goes.</p>

<hr /><p>Being able to use F# for the client as well as the server is a great way for F# developers to not only build web applications without having to use JavaScript and any of their frameworks, but also so they can utilize their functional programming knowledge to reduce bugs in the code.</p>
<p>If I were building web apps for personal or freelance work, I'll definitely give the SAFE Stack a try. I believe my productivity and efficiency of building the web applications will be much better with it.</p>
<p>To learn more (there is a good bit to learn since we're not only using functional patterns in a web application, we are also using the model view update pattern for the UI) I highly recommend the <a href="https://safe-stack.github.io/docs/component-elmish/">Elmish documentation</a> and <a href="https://zaid-ajaj.github.io/the-elmish-book/#/chapters/elm/the-architecture">Elmish book</a> by <a href="https://github.com/Zaid-Ajaj">Zaid Ajaj</a>. I'll be referencing these a lot in the days to come.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Introduction to QnA Maker</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/01/17/introduction-to-qna-maker</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Suppose you have a FAQ page that has a lot of data and want to use that as a first line of customer service support for a chat bot on your main page. How can you integrate this with minimal effort? Enter Microsoft Q&amp;A Maker.</p><p>For the video verison of this post, check below.</p>



 
   <iframe class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FqhAPQEE7Gow%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DqhAPQEE7Gow&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FqhAPQEE7Gow%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
 

<h2 id="what-is-microsoft-qna-maker">What is Microsoft QnA Maker</h2><p>From the official <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/QnAMaker/Overview/overview">docs</a> it states that...</p><blockquote>
<p>QnA Maker is a cloud-based Natural Language Processing (NLP) service that allows you to create a natural conversational layer over your data.</p>
</blockquote><p>So, basically, this service allows you to creates question and answering based on the data that you have.</p><h2 id="creating-the-azure-resource">Creating the Azure Resource</h2><p>First thing, like for all Cognitive Services items, we need to create the Azure resource. When creating a new resource, you can search for "QnA" and select "QnA Maker".</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/ebe0585c-e14b-4dfe-967c-c3232465cd32/Pasted+image+20211208170245.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>After clicking "Create" on that, we're on a screen where we have to enter a few things. First, we will supply the subscription, resource group, name, and pricing tier. Note that this does have a free tier so this can be used for proof of concepts or to simply try out the service to see if it meets your needs.</p><p>Next, it will ask for details for Azure Search. This is used to host the data that you give it for the QnA maker and Azure Search is used for that. Only the location and pricing tier is needed for this. This has a free tier, as well.</p><p>Last, it will ask details for an App Service. This is used to host the runtime for QnA maker which will be used to make queries against your data. The app name and location is required for this.</p><p>You can optionally enable app insights for this service as well, but feel free to disable that since it's not really needed unless you are creating this for actual business purposes and want to see if anything goes wrong.</p><p>With all that, we can click the "Review and Create" button to create and deploy the resources.</p><h2 id="creating-a-qna-knowledge-base">Creating a QnA Knowledge Base</h2><p>With the resource created we can now go to it. Per usual with the Cognitive Services items, we have a "Keys and Endpoint" item on the left where we can get the key and endpoint. This will be used later when using the API.</p><p>But first, we need to create our QnA Knowledge Base and to do that we need to go to the "Overview" tab on the left navigation. A bit down it has a link where we can go to the QnA portal to create a new knowledge base.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/80eb7912-c070-4c2c-a65c-46d6d31b3d3f/Pasted+image+20211208172042.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>We can skip step one since we already created the Azure resource. In step two, we will connect the QnA portal to our Azure resource. Simply give it the subscription and the Azure service name. Luckily, all of this pre-populates so they are all dropdowns.</p><p>In step three, we will give our knowledge base a name. We'll name it "ikea" since we will use the Ikea FAQ to populate the knowledge base.</p><p>Step four is where we'll populate the knowledge base. If you already have a FAQ on your website you can put the URL in. Since I'm using the <a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/customer-service/faq/">Ikea FAQ</a> we can do that. You can also add a file for this. If you have neither, you can leave this blank and fill out the questions and answers manually on the next page.</p><p>Below this you can customize your bot with a chit-chat. This just helps give your QnA bot a bit more personality based on what you select. Here's a screenshot of an example from <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/qnamaker/how-to/chit-chat-knowledge-base">the docs</a> of each of the chit-chat items that you can choose from.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/0ead30e5-29d8-474e-abf1-c3e86e978466/Pasted+image+20211211073427.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>For step five, we can create our knowledge base by clicking on the button.</p><h2 id="training-and-testing">Training and Testing</h2><p>Once we have our knowledge base created we can look see that it read in the Ikea FAQ quite well. To see just how well QnA Maker is, we can instantly click on the "Save and train" button to train a model on our data.</p><p>Once that finishes we can click on the "Test" button to give the model a test. This is an integrated chat bot where we can ask it questions and will receive answers based on the model.</p><p>So we can ask "What is the return policy?" and QnA Maker will give us the best answer based on our data.</p>

<p>Early on we get some good results from QnA Maker. But what if we want to add a new pair?</p><h2 id="adding-a-new-qna-pair">Adding a New QnA Pair</h2><p>If we want to add new QnA pairs to our existing knowledge base, just click on the <strong>Add QnA Pair</strong> button.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/9573a02d-7358-4902-92e7-a854a1caedff/Pasted+image+20211214121558.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>We can add an alternate phrasing such as "This is a question". A phrasing is mostly a question that a user would input into the system that will get sent to QnA Maker. We can input an answer as well, such as "This is an answer". Notice that we have a rich text editor which can be toggled in the upper left. With this, we can add graphics, links, and emojis. Let's add a smile emoji to our answer.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/12d53b3f-0af3-4f62-9e0f-b1d58c7b305b/Pasted+image+20211215135503.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Now we can click the "Save and train" button to train a new model on what we just added. We can then do another test and in put "This is a question" and we should get the answer that we put as the output.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/7e4c8ab8-f9a3-4933-93cb-0340efee0038/Pasted+image+20211215135614.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="using-the-api">Using the API</h2><p>Before we can actually use the API we need to publish our knowledge base. Simply click the "Publish" tab near the top and then the "Publish" button.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/3c4422f2-841d-489b-b803-f3da8d9c7151/Pasted+image+20211216130209.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Once that completes you can either create a bot that will use this knoweldge base, or you can use the API directly. We'll use the API and the publish page shows how you can call the API using Postman or through curl. We'll use Postman here so we can easily test the API out.</p><p>To build the URL for the API, use the "Host" item in the deployment details and then append the first item where it has "POST" after that.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/b89b2b9b-9675-455f-947b-755035c09eb9/Pasted+image+20211218012805.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>And since it does say "POST" we will make this as a POST call.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/0f9d72bd-83ba-42b4-a5d0-d439cd1fc342/Pasted+image+20211218012807.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Next, we need to set the authorization header. In the Authorization tab in Postman, set the type to "API Key". The "Key" item will be "Authorization" and the "Value" will be the API key which is the third part of the deployment details.</p><p>Now, we can add in the JSON body and the simplest JSON that we can add has only one item, a "question" item. And this is the prompt that a user would send to QnA Maker. Let's add the question that we added earlier.</p><pre><code>{
 "question":"This is a question"
}</code></pre><p>Once we hit "Send" in Postman, we will get the below response. </p><pre><code>{
     "answers": [
     {
         "questions": [
             "This is a question"
         ],
         "answer": "This is an answer😀",
         "score": 100.0,
         "id": 176,
         "source": "Editorial",
         "isDocumentText": false,
         "metadata": [],
         "context": {
             "isContextOnly": false,
             "prompts": []
         }

    }
 ],
 "activeLearningEnabled": false
}</code></pre><p>The main part to notice here is the "answer", which is what we expect to get back.</p><hr><p>Hopefully, this showed how useful the QnA Maker can be, especially if you already have a FAQ page with questions and answers. With QnA Maker it can be turned into a chat bot or any other automation tool where users or customers may need to ask questions.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Use Bing Image Search to Get Training Image Data</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/12/6/use-bing-image-search-to-get-training-image-data6</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When going through the FastAI book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3FIWUsw">Deep Learning for Coders</a>, I noticed that in one of the early chapters they mention using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/search-apis/bing-image-search/overview">Bing Image Search API</a> to retrieve images for training data. While they have a nice wrapper for the API, I thought I'd dive into the API as well and use it to build my own way to download training image data.</p>
<p>Let's suppose we need to make an image classification model to determine what kind of car is in an image. We'd need quite a bit of different images for this model, so let's use the Bing Image Search to gather images of the Aston-Martin car so we can start getting our data.</p>
<p>Check out the below for a video version of this post.</p>




 
   <iframe class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FlKCxQ6mxuy0%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DlKCxQ6mxuy0&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FlKCxQ6mxuy0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
 

<h2 id="why-bing-image-search">Why Bing Image Search</h2>
<p>Before going into the technical side of Bing Image Search, let's go over why use this in the first place. Why not just download the images ourselves?</p>
<p>Bing Images Search has a few features in it that we can utilize in our code when getting our images. Some of these features are important to take into account.</p>
<h3 id="automation">Automation</h3>
<p>I'll be honest, I'm lazy and if I can script something to do a task for me then I'll definitely spend the time to build the script rather than do the task manually. Rather than manually finding images and downloading them, we can use the Bing Image Search API to do this for us.</p>
<h3 id="image-license">Image License</h3>
<p>We can't always just take an image from a website and use it however we want. A lot of images that are online are copyrighted and if we don't have a license to use the copyright we are actually in violation of the creator's copyright. If they find out we use their image without a license or permission then they can, more than likely, take legal action against us.</p>
<p>However, with Bing Image Search, we have an option to specify what license the images has that get returned to us. We can do this with the <code>licenseType</code> query parameter in our API call. This utilizes <a href="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> licenses. We can specify exactly what type of license our images has. We can specify that want images that are public where the copyright is fully waived, which is what we will do. There are many Creative Commons license types that the Bing Image Search supports and there's a full list <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/search-apis/bing-image-search/reference/query-parameters#license">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="image-type">Image Type</h3>
<p>There are quite a few images types that we could download from Bing Image Search. For our purposes, though, we only want photos of Aston Martin cars. Due to that, we can specify the image type in our API calls to just <code>photo</code>. If we don't specify this we could get back animated GIFs, clip art, or drawings of Aston Martin cars.</p>
<h3 id="safe-content">Safe Content</h3>
<p>When downloading images from the internet you never really know what you're going to get. Bing Image Search can help ease that worry by specifying that you want only safe content to be returned.</p>
<p>Bing can do this filtering for us so we don't have to worry about it when we do our API call. This is one less thing we have to worry about and, because it's the internet, it's definitely something to worry about when download images.</p>
<h2 id="create-azure-resource">Create Azure Resource</h2>
<p>Before we can use the Bing Image Search API we need to create the resource for it. In the Azure Portal create a new resource and search for "Bing Search". Then, click on the "Bing Search v7" resource to create it.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/88d0d438-613b-48a0-bdae-79183fdea0fb/Pasted+image+20211127081402.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>When creating the resource give it a name, what resource group it will be under, and what subscription it will be under. For the pricing tier, it does have a free tier to allow you to give the service a try for evaluation or for a proof of concept. Once that is complete, click "Create".</p>
<p>When that completes deployment, we can explore a bit on the resource page. One thing to note is that there are a few things we can look at here. There's a "Try me" tab where we can try the Bing Search API and see what results we get. There is some sample code to see real quick how to use the Bing Search API. And there are a lot of tutorials that we can look at if we want to look at something more specific, such as the image or video search APIs.</p>




  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/992b1ab5-e64b-4e5c-a392-0c1b4705b4a8/Pasted+image+20211127083005.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<h2 id="retrieve-key-and-endpoint">Retrieve Key and Endpoint</h2><p>To use the API in our code we will need the API key and the endpoint to call. There are a couple of ways we can get to it. First, on the "Overview" page of the resource there's a link that says to "click here to manage keys". Clicking that will take you to another page where you can get the API keys and the endpoint URL.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/6f75c579-89c9-4226-92ec-c0e4b98cd2d6/Pasted+image+20211128053009.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>You can also click on the "Keys and Endpoint" section on the left navigation.</p>



  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/0b347e5f-60a2-4054-a7f9-ae5c67729e67/Pasted+image+20211128052911.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  

<p>Now save the API key and the endpoint since we'll need those to access the API in the code.</p><h2 id="using-the-api">Using the API</h2><p>Now we get to the fun stuff where we can get into some code. I'll be using Python, but you're very welcome to use the language of your choice since this is a simple API call. I'm also using Azure ML since it's very easy to get a Jupyter Lab instance running plus most machine learning and data science packages already installed.</p><h3 id="imports">Imports</h3><p>First, we need to import some modules. We have four that we will need to import.</p><ul>
<li><strong>JSON</strong>: This will be used to read in a config file for the API key and endpoint</li>
<li><strong>Requests</strong>: Will be used to make the API calls. This is pre-installed in an Azure ML Jupyter instance, so you may need to run <code>pip install requests</code> if you are using another envrionment.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong>: Used to delay API calls so the server doesn't get hit too much by requests.</li>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Used to saved and help clean image data on the local machine.</li>
<li><strong>PPrint</strong>: Used to format JSON when printing.</li>
</ul><pre><code>import json
import requests
import time
import os
import pprint</code></pre><h3 id="the-api-call">The API Call</h3><p>Now, we can start building and making the API call to get the image data. </p><h4 id="building-the-endpoint">Building the Endpoint</h4><p>To start building the call, we need to get the API key which is kept in a JSON file for security reasons. We'll use the <code>open</code> method to open the file to be able to read it and use the <code>json</code> module to load the JSON file. This creates a dictionary where the JSON keys are the key names of the dictionary where you can get the values.</p><pre><code>config = json.load(open("config.json"))

api_key = config["apiKey"]</code></pre><p>Now that we have the API key we can build up the URL to make the API call. We can use the endpoint that we got from the Azure Portal and help build up the URL.</p><pre><code>endpoint = "https://api.bing.microsoft.com/"</code></pre><p>With the endpoint, we have to add some to it to tell it that we want the Image Search API. To learn more about the exact endpoints we're using here, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bing/search-apis/bing-image-search/reference/endpoints">this doc</a> has a lot of good information.</p><pre><code>url = f"{endpoint}v7.0/images/search"</code></pre><h4 id="building-the-headers-and-query-parameters">Building the Headers and Query Parameters</h4><p>Some more information we need to add to our call are the headers and the query parameters. The headers is where we supply the API key and the query parameters detail what images we want to return.</p><p>Requests makes it easy to specify the headers, which is done as a dictionary. We need to supply the <code>Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key</code> header for the API key.</p><pre><code>headers = { "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key": api_key }</code></pre><p>The query parameters are also done as a dictionary. We'll supply the license, image type, and safe search parameters here. Those are optional parameters, but the <code>q</code> parameter is required which is what query we want to use to search for images. For our query here, we'll search for aston martin cars.</p><pre><code>params = {
    "q": "aston martin", 
    "license": "public", 
    "imageType": "photo",
    "safeSearch": "Strict",
}</code></pre><h4 id="making-the-api-call">Making the API Call</h4><p>With everything ready, we can now make the API call and get the results. With <code>requests</code> we can just call the <code>get</code> method. In there we pass in the URl, the headers, and the parameters. We use the <code>raise_for_status</code> method to throw an exception if the status code isn't successful. Then, we get the JSON of the response and store that into a variable. Finally, we use the pretty print method to print the JSON response.</p><pre><code>response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
response.raise_for_status()

result = response.json()

pprint.pprint(result)</code></pre><p>And here's a snapshot of the response. There's quite a bit here but we'll break it down some later in this post.</p><pre><code>{'_type': 'Images',

            'width': 1920}]</code></pre><p>A few things to note from the response:</p><ul>
<li><code>nextOffset</code>: This will help us page items to perform multiple requests.</li>
<li><code>value.contentUrl</code>: This is the actual URL of the image. We will use this URL to download the images.</li>
</ul><h3 id="paging-through-results">Paging Through Results</h3><p>For a single API call we may get around 30 items or so by default. How do we get more images with the API? We page through the results. And the way to do this is to use the <code>nextOffset</code> item in the API response. We can use this value to pass in another query parameter <code>offset</code> to give the next page of results.</p><p>So if I only want at most 200 images, I can use the below code to page through the API results.</p><pre><code>new_offset = 0

while new_offset &lt;= 200:
    print(new_offset)
    params["offset"] = new_offset

    response = requests.get(url, headers=headers, params=params)
    response.raise_for_status()

    result = response.json()

    time.sleep(1)

    new_offset = result["nextOffset"]

    for item in result["value"]:
        contentUrls.append(item["contentUrl"])</code></pre><p>We initialize the offset to 0 so the initial call will give the first page of results. In the <code>while</code> loop we limit to just 200 images for the offset. Within the loop we set the <code>offset</code> parameter to the current offset, which will be 0 initially. Then we make the API call, we sleep or wait for one second, and we set the <code>offset</code> parameter to the <code>nextOffset</code> from the results and save the <code>contentUrl</code> items from the results into a list. Then, we do it again until we reach the limit of our offset.</p><h3 id="downloading-the-images">Downloading the Images</h3><p>In the previous API calls all we did was capture the <code>contentUrl</code> items from each of the images. In order to get the images as training data we need to download them. Before we do that, let's set up our paths to be ready for images to be downloaded to them. First we set the path and then we use the <code>os</code> module to check if the path exists. If it doesn't, we'll create it.</p><pre><code>dir_path = "./aston-martin/train/"

if not os.path.exists(dir_path):
    os.makedirs(dir_path)</code></pre><p>Generally, we could just do the below code and loop through all of the content URL items and for each one we create the path with the <code>os.path.join</code> method to get the correct path for the system we're on, and open the path with the <code>open</code> method. With that we can use <code>requests</code> again with the <code>get</code> method and pass in the URL. Then, with the <code>open</code> function, we can write to the path from the image contents.</p><pre><code>for url in contentUrls:
    path = os.path.join(dir_path, url)

    try:
        with open(path, "wb") as f:
            image_data = requests.get(url)

            f.write(image_data.content)
    except OSError:
        pass</code></pre><p>However, this is a bit more complicated than we would hope it would be.</p><h3 id="cleaning-the-image-data">Cleaning the Image Data</h3><p>If we print the image URLs for all that we get back it would look something like this:</p><pre><code>https://www.publicdomainpictures.net/pictures/380000/velka/aston-martin-car-1609287727yik.jpg

While most of then end in <code>jpeg</code> there are a few with some extra parameters on the end. If we try to download with those URLs we won't get the image. So we need to do a little bit of data cleaning here.</p><p>Luckily, there are two patterns we can check, if there is a <code>?</code> in the URL and if there is a <code>!</code> in the URL. With those patterns we can update our loop to download the images to the below to get the correct URLs for all images.</p><pre><code>for url in contentUrls:
    split = url.split("/")

    last_item = split[-1]

    second_split = last_item.split("?")

    if len(second_split) &gt; 1:
        last_item = second_split[0]

    third_split = last_item.split("!")

    if len(third_split) &gt; 1:
        last_item = third_split[0]

    print(last_item)
    path = os.path.join(dir_path, last_item)

    try:
        with open(path, "wb") as f:
            image_data = requests.get(url)
            #image_data.raise_for_status()

            f.write(image_data.content)
    except OSError:
        pass</code></pre><p>With this cleaning of the URLs we can get the full images.</p>

      <title>AI Ethics and Fairness Resources</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/25/ai-ethics-and-fairness-resources8</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">AI and data ethics and fairness is becoming a very hot topic lately. With computer vision models not being able to see everyone equally to the debacle at Google's AI division, it's something that we all need to look out for when doing any type of work with data.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that, I'd like to show some resources I found that has been useful when researching this topic. Some are videos that go over how bias can get into data and others are actual research papers that go over how to help mitigate bias.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For a video version of this post, check below:</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Videos</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are quite a lot of videos that go over AI ethics. Below are a few of my favorites that have a good amount of information in them.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMym_BKWQzk" target="_blank">The Trouble with Bias</a> by Kate Crawford - This talk, given at the Neural Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS) in 2017. Not only does Kate goes over what exactly is bias in machine learning models, but she also goes over the harms that it can cause.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtN6Qx4KddY" target="_blank">Machine Learning and Fairness</a> by Hanna Wallach and Jennifer Wortman Vaughan - This is actually one of my favorite resources on the list. This video goes into several aspects of fairness in machine learning including types of bias that can be in your data as well as ways to help mitigate it such as the Datasheets for Data paper that's linked in the papers section.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-TSjiXGfSI" target="_blank">Transparency and Intelligibility Throughout the Machine Learning Life Cycle</a> by Jennifer Wortman Vaughan - This goes through the entire machine learning life cycle to best incorporate transparency throughout the life cycle.</p></li></ul><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Courses</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are a couple of courses that go over AI ethics and I believe more will be on the way as time goes on.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://ethics.fast.ai/" target="_blank">FastAI Ethics</a> - FastAI's ethics course is probably one of the most comprehensive out there. It has several lectures and each lecture has supplemental materials such as articles and even research papers.</p></li></ul><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Books</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just like courses are coming to teach people about AI ethics, books are also coming to do the same and also to help how you can prevent bias from creeping into your models.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.manning.com/books/interpretable-ai" target="_blank">Interpretable AI</a> by Ajay Thampi - One of the first books I've seen on this subject, this book helps you understand why the need for having models that are interpretable and shows how to do it.</p></li></ul><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Papers and Documents</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A lot of the information in the other categories come from earlier research done on data bias and AI ethics. As a result of the research some documents have also come out of it to help people creating models to mitigate the amount of bias in their data.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/manipulating-and-measuring-model-interpretability/" target="_blank">Manipulating and Measuring Model Interpretability</a> - This paper goes into how to measure model interpretability. It also helps answer the question about what is interpretability in terms of a machine learning model.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.09010.pdf" target="_blank">Datasheets for Datasets</a> - In electronics, there is a datasheet accompanied by each component that describes its characteristics, any testing done on it, etc. This paper proposes the idea of having the same for machine learning data.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/ai-fairness-checklist/" target="_blank">AI Fairness Checklist</a> - This document has a checklist that one can follow throughout the lifecycle of creating a model to lookout for fairness.</p></li></ul><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Tools</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Thankfully, there are some tools out there that can help us interpret how models are making their predictions as well as assessing fairness within the models.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://fairlearn.org/" target="_blank">Microsoft Fairlearn</a> - This Python tool helps access the fairness in your data. There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ts6tB2p97ek" target="_blank">demo</a> available for this that helps show how it works.</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><a href="https://interpret.ml/" target="_blank">Microsoft InterpretML</a> - Another Python tool to help interpret machine learning models. This one also has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WwBeKMQ0-I8" target="_blank">demo</a> available.</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hopefully, this list gave you a good idea about data and AI ethics and fairness. There are definitely many more resources out there and I have been partial to Microsoft for their research and resources.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There will be more posts on ethics and fairness in the future, as well. Especially covering the two tools from Microsoft, Fairlearn and InterpretML.</p>

      <title>Perform Linear Regression in Azure Databricks with MLLib</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/4/11/perform-linear-regression-in-azure-databricks-with-mllib</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When thinking of performing machine learning, especially in Python, a few frameworks may come to mind such as scikit-learn, Tensorflow, and PyTorch. However, if you're already doing your big data processing in Spark, then it actually comes with its own machine learning framework - <a href="https://spark.apache.org/mllib/" target="_blank">MLLib</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In this post, we'll go over using MLLib to create a regression model within Azure Databricks. The data we'll be using is the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Computer+Hardware" target="_blank">Computer Hardware dataset</a> from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The data will be on an Azure Blob storage container, so we'll need to fetch the data from there to work with it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What we would want to predict from this data is the published performance of the machine based off of its features. There is a second performance column at the end, but looking at the data description that is what the original authors predicted using their algorithm. We can safely ignore that column.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you would prefer a video version of this post, check below.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Connecting to Azure Storage</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Within a new notebook, we can set some variables, such as the storage account name and what container the data is in. We can also get the storage account key from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWGNPc1u7w0&amp;t=1s" target="_blank">Secrets utility method</a>.</p><pre><code>storage_account_name = "databricksdemostorage"
storage_account_key = dbutils.secrets.get("Keys", "Storage")
container = "data"</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After that we can set a Spark config setting specifically within Azure Databricks that can connect the Spark APIs to our storage container.</p><pre><code>spark.conf.set(f"fs.azure.account.key.{storage_account_name}.blob.core.windows.net", storage_account_key)</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For more details on connecting to Azure Storage from Azure Databricks, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7d7DCzFtgCA" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618133574181-MOPTDVV2A2G8UN3D2K74/post1.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Using the APIs we can use the <code>read</code> property on the <code>spark</code> variable (which is the SparkSession) and set some options such as telling it to automatically infer the schema and what the delimiter is. Then the <code>csv</code> method is called with the Windows Azure Storage Blob URL (WASB), which <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-hadoop-use-blob-storage#access-files-from-within-cluster" target="_blank">is built on top of HDFS</a>. With the data fetched we then call the <code>show</code> method on it.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">However, looking at the data, it defaults the column names. Since we'll be referencing the columns, it'll be nice to have names to them to make referencing them easier. To do this we can create our own schema and use that when reading the data.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To read the schema we'll need to create it using <code>StructType</code> and <code>StructField</code> which help specify a schema for a Spark DataFrame. Don't forget to import these from <code>pyspark.sql.types</code>.</p>
</div>
























<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With this schema set we can pass that into the <code>read</code> property with the <code>schema</code> method and pass this in as the parameter. Since we pass in the schema we no longer need the <code>inferSchema</code> option. Also, we can now tell Spark to use a header row.</p>
</div>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Splitting the Data</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With our data now set, we can start building our linear regression machine learning model with it. The first thing to do, though, is to split our data into a training and testing set. We can do this with the <code>randomSplit</code> method on the Spark DataFrame.</p><pre><code>(train_data, test_data) = data.randomSplit([0.8, 0.2])</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The <code>randomSplit</code> method takes in a list as a parameter and the first item of the list is how much to keep in the training set and the second item is how much to take in the testing set. This returns a tuple which is why there are parentheses around the variables.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Just because I'm curious, let's see what the count of each of these dataframes are.</p><pre><code>print(train_data.count())
print(test_data.count())</code></pre>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618397388137-HI0HI2OEE140K1HA68K5/post3.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Creating Linear Regression Model</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before we can go further, we need to make some additional imports. We need to import the <code>LinearRegression</code> class, a class to help us vectorize our features, and a class that can help us evaluate our model based on the test data.</p><pre><code>from pyspark.ml.regression import LinearRegression
from pyspark.ml.feature import VectorAssembler
from pyspark.ml.evaluation import RegressionEvaluator</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now, we can begin building our machine learning model. The first thing we need is to create a "features" column. This column will be an array of all of our numerical columns. This is what the <code>VectorAssembler</code> class can do for us.</p><pre><code>vectors = VectorAssembler(inputCols=['CycleTime', 'MinMainMemory', 'MaxMainMemory', 'Cache', 'MinChannels', 'MaxChannels'], outputCol="features")

vector_data = vectors.transform(train_data)</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the <code>VectorAssembler</code> we give it a list of input columns that we want to vectorize into a single column. There's also an output column parameter in which we specify what we want the name of the new column to be.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">NOTE: To keep this simple, I'll exclude the text columns. Don't worry, though, we'll go over how to handle this in a future post/video.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can call the <code>show</code> method on the vector data to see how that looks.</p><pre><code>vector_data.show()</code></pre>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618397398612-KQW3DUP242G69GJJZLFO/post4.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Notice the "features" column was appended on to the DataFrame. Also, you can tell that the values match each value in the other columns in that row. For instance, the first value in the "features" column is 29 and the first value in the "CycleTime" column is 29.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let's clean up the DataFrame a bit and only have the columns we care about, the "features" and "RelativePerf" columns. We can do that just by using the <code>select</code> method.</p><pre><code>features_data = vector_data.select(["features", "PublishedPerf"])

features_data.show()</code></pre>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618397423993-WTS5MV8IWZP8HCIO4T4Q/post5.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With our data now updated to the format the algorithm wants, let's actually create the model. This is where we use the <code>LinearRegression</code> class from the import.</p><pre><code>lr = LinearRegression(labelCol="PublishedPerf", featuresCol="features")</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With that class we give it a couple of parameters in the constructor, what the label column name is and what the name of the features column is.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now we can fit the model based on our data.</p><pre><code>model = lr.fit(features_data)</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And now we have our model! We can look into it by getting the model summary and examining the R Squared on it.</p><pre><code>summary = model.summary

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">From here, it looks like it performs quite well with an R Squared of around 91%. But let's evaluate the model on the test data set. This is where we use the <code>RegressionEvaluator</code> class we imported.</p><pre><code>evaluator = RegressionEvaluator(predictionCol="prediction", labelCol="PublishedPerf", metricName="r2")</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This takes in a few constructor parameters which include the label column name, the metric name we want to use for our evaluation, and the prediction column. The prediction column we'll get when we when we run the model on our test set.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With our evaluator defined, we can now start to pass data to it. But first, we actually need to make our test dataset into the same format that we did our training data set. So we'll need to follow the same steps to vectorize our data.</p><pre><code>vector_test = vectors.transform(test_data)</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Then, select the columns we care about using.</p><pre><code>features_test = vector_test.select(["features", "PublishedPerf"])</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now we can use the model to make predictions on our test data set and we'll show those results.</p><pre><code>test_transform = model.transform(features_test)

test_transform.show()</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The prediction column are the predicted values. You can do a bit of a comparison to that and the "PublishedPerf" column. Do you think this model will perform well based on what you see?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With the predictions on the test dataset we can now evaluate our model based on that data.</p><pre><code>evaluator.evaluate(test_transform)</code></pre>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618397434568-5WDO413IPUN0EJSGHDE5/post8.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Looks like the model doesn't perform very well with this R Squared being 56%, so there is probably some feature engineering we can do.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you watched the video and saw that the evaluation returned 90%, then it's possible the split got different data that caused this discrepancy. This is a good reason to run cross validation on your data.</p>

  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hopefully, you've learned some things with this post about using MLLib in Azure Databricks. Things to take away is that MLLib is built into Spark and, therefore, built into Azure Databricks so there's no need to install another library to perform machine learning on your data.</p>

      <title>How to Build the ML.NET Repository</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/4/28/how-to-build-the-mlnet-repository</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Have you wanted to contribute a bug fix or a new feature to the ML.NET repository? The first step is to pull down the repository from GitHub and get it built successfully so you can start making changes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ML.NET repository has great documentation. Part of it is how to build it locally from this doc. In this post, we'll go over the steps to do this so you can do the same and get started making changes to the ML.NET repository.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For a video version of this post, check below.</p>
</div>

























 
   <iframe class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FQUyZL_Tea7A%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DQUyZL_Tea7A&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FQUyZL_Tea7A%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
 



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Fork the Repository</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The first thing to do, if you haven't already, is to fork the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning" target="_blank">ML.NET repository</a>.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1619593706109-DNB75LK5H7357FM3NI97/image+%281%29.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you haven't forked the repository yet, you're good to go to the next step. However, for me, since I have already forked the repository a while back, I need to make sure I have the latest.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are two ways to do sync up my fork with the main repository - running git commands or letting GitHub do it for you.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Syncing the Fork</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can run some git commands to sync up. GitHub has <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/syncing-a-fork" target="_blank">good documentation</a> on how to do this for a more detailed explanation.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The first thing is to is to make sure you have an <code>upstream</code> remote set up to point to the main repository.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To check if you have it you can run the <code>git remote -v</code> command. If there is only an <code>origin</code> remote then you would need to add an <code>upstream</code> remote that points to the original repository.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1619593858898-FDAMH7OD5VNHSLG6NBNF/image+%282%29.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you don't have it set, this can be set with the following command.</p><pre><code>git remote add upstream git@github.com:dotnet/machinelearning.git</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Note that I have SSH set up so I use the SSH clone link. If you don't have this set up you can use the HTTPS link instead.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">After setting the <code>upstream</code> remote, we need to get the latest from the</p><pre><code>git fetch upstream</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once the upstream fetched we can merge those changes into our fork. Make sure you’re in the default branch and run this command to merge in the changes.</p><pre><code>git merge upstream/main</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now you can start working on the latest code base.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Note here that I attempted to use GitHub to sync my fork. Unfortunately, it seems to not do as good of a job as the git commands.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Install Dependencies</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Before we can start to build the code, there is a dependency we need to install. This dependency is included with a <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules" target="_blank">git submodule</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you run the build before this step you will get errors, so it's best to do this before running the build.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">To install the submodule dependencies, run the below command.</p><pre><code>git submodule update --init</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With the submodules installed we can now run the build through the command line.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Build on the Command Line</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The build command is made very well in the <a href="http://ML.NET" target="_blank">ML.NET</a> repository so there's very little you have to do to actually run it. We can run this on the command line. The script you run will depend on if you use Windows or Linux/Mac.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For Windows, you would run <code>build.cmd</code> and for Mac/Linux you would run <code>build.sh</code>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The first time you run it will take a while. It needs to download several assets, such as NuGet packages and models for testing. After you download all of this, though, subsequent builds will go much faster.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Build in Visual Studio</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">With the main build now complete we can now build within Visual Studio. Although, currently, you may get an error in the <code>Microsoft.ML.Samples.GPU</code> project.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1619593799577-1HFE8ZP3TG38ZFRZMW15/image+%283%29.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Why do we get this error in Visual Studio and not when we ran the build on the command line? It turns out that Visual Studio was set to have compile errors on warnings. There are a couple of things you can do to fix this.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First, since this is a samples project, the simplest thing is to just comment out the method. Instead of doing that, though, we can update the build properties of the project. We can either set the "treat warnings as errors" to "None".</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1619593889820-26XYJT3JN2Q10FHWMEW3/image+%284%29.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Or, we can update the "Suppress warnings" to specify this specific warning. To get the warning we can go back and highlight the error with our cursor which will bring up a tooltip describing the error. It has a link to the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/compiler-messages/cs0618?f1url=%3FappId%3Droslyn%26k%3Dk(CS0618)" target="_blank">CS0618 </a>warning. We can put in the number in the "suppress warnings" section, 0618, and save the project.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1619593913620-MJB70DVEIZSC53BIGG8U/image+%285%29.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now we can fully build the solution in Visual Studio. Although, take note about this change when committing any other changes. You can either not include this change or include it and make a comment to discuss with the <a href="http://ML.NET" target="_blank">ML.NET</a> team about it.</p>
</div>

      <title>What's New in the Model Builder Preview</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/5/10/whats-new-in-the-model-builder-preview</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The ML.NET graphical tool, Model Builder, continues to get better and better for everyone to work with and, most important, for everyone to get into machine learning. Recently, there have been some really good additions to Model Builder that we will go over in this post. We will go through the entire flow for Model Builder and will highlight each of the new items.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If you prefer to see a video of these updates, check the video below.</p>
</div>

























 
   <iframe class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2F7Y4lb_BWUs0&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7Y4lb_BWUs0&image=http%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2F7Y4lb_BWUs0%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
 



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The team is testing out these new preview items so it currently needs to be opt-in through this <a href="http://aka.ms/blog-mb-preview" target="_blank">Microsoft form</a> in order to participate in it. Once you sign up there you will receive an email with instructions on how to install the preview version.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For even more information about this version of Model Builder and ML.NET version 1.5.5, checkout this Microsoft <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/ml-net-and-model-builder-march-updates/#model-builder-preview" target="_blank">blog post</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The data for this post will be this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/shrutimehta/nasa-asteroids-classification" target="_blank">NASA Asteroids Classification</a> dataset. We will use this to determine if an asteroid can be potentially hazardous or not. That is, if it would come close to Earth enough to be a threat.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Perhaps the biggest addition to the preview version is the new Model Builder config file. Let's look at this being used in action.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once you have the preview version installed perform the same steps as usual to bring up Model Builder by right clicking on a project and selecting Add -&gt; Machine Learning. It will now bring up a dialog for your Model Builder project.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618829542290-3XG190SK91SS8G1UEWEZ/post1-1.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here we can give our Model Builder project a name. We'll name it Asteroids and click to continue. Now the regular Model Builder window shows up, but if you look at the Solution explorer there was a new file added. It was that <code>mbconfig</code> file. We will look at what's in this file later.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can use Model Builder like usual through the first couple of steps. We'll choose the Classification scenario and will train this locally. Then, we'll add the file and this may take a few seconds since there's a lot of data in here.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once it's loaded we can specify the label column, which will be the "Hazardous" column at the end.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let's now explore our updated data options that we get with this preview version. To get there, select the "Advanced data options" link below where you choose where the data is located. This opens a new dialog that shows how we can update the data options. These will be auto-filled based on what Model Builder determines from the data. If you want to override them, these options are available.</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Note that there's a small bug in the current version for dark theme of Visual Studio. I have created <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues/1410">an issue</a> to let the team know about it. For this section, I'll use the light theme.</p></blockquote>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The first section, after the column names, is what purpose the column is. Is it a feature or a label? If it's neither we can select to ignore the column.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The last section is a checkbox to tell Model Builder if this column is a categorical feature, meaning that there are a distinct number of string entries in there. Model Builder already determined that the "Orbiting body" column is categorical.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Also, notice that we can filter out the columns with the text field on the upper right. So if I wanted to see all the columns with "orbit" in the name I can just type that in and it will filter them out for me. This is definitely helpful for datasets that have a lot of features.</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Compare this to what we had in the previous version. These new options give you the same thing, but they are now simpler and show more within the dialog.</p>
</div>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The data formatting options haven't changed, though. That's where you can specify if the data has a header row, what the delimiter is, or specify if the decimals in the file use a dot (.) or a comma (,).</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now we can train our model. I'll set the train time to be 20 seconds and fire it off to see how it goes.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Our top five models actually look pretty good. The top trainer has micro and macro accuracies at around 99%!</p><pre><code>|                                 Top 5 models explored                                   |

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</code></pre><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Let's now go straight to the consume step. There's a bit more information here than the previous version.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618829681558-RXHB68NZRIMCF2MYEAJB/post1-8.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Here they give you the option to add consuming the model as projects within your current solution. Keep a watch on this page, though, as I'm sure more options will be coming. They also give you some sample data in which you can use to help test the consumption of your model.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now, let's take a moment and look again at our <code>mbconfig</code> file. In fact, you will notice a couple of more files here.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618829697404-7KJWJQJV7STHXNJAUZJA/post1-9.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are now consumption and training files that we can look at. These files are similar to the training and consuming projects that would get added to your solution but you don't have to add them as separate projects if you don't want.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">By the way, if for any reason, we need to close the dialog and come back to it at another time to change the data options or increase the time to run we can double click on the <code>mbconfig</code> file to bring it back. This not only brings back the Model Builder dialog, but it also retains the state of it so we don't have to do it all over again.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The reason for that is, if we open the <code>mbconfig</code> file in a JSON editor, it keeps track of everything in this file.</p>
</div>

























  
      <img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1618829711446-6MW6EBYKI3L0U55B7EW7/post1-10.png?format=original" alt=""/>
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This keeps track of everything, even the history of all of the runs within Model Builder! And, since this is a JSON file, we can keep this in version control so teams can work on this together to get the best model they can.</p>
</div>






















<hr />

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hopefully, this showed how much the team has done to help improve Model Builder. Definitely give feedback on their <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning-modelbuilder/issues" target="_blank">GitHub issues page</a> for any issues or feature requests.</p>

      <title>How the Machine Learning Process is Like Cooking</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/5/17/how-the-machine-learning-process-is-like-cooking</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">When creating machine learning models it's important to follow the machine learning process in order to get the best performing model that you can into production and to keep it performing well.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">But why cooking? First, I enjoy cooking. But also, it is something we all do. Now, we all don't make five course meals every day or aim to be a Michelin star chef. We do follow a process to make our food, though, even if it may be to just heat it up in the microwave.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In this post, I'll go over the machine learning process and how it relates to cooking to give a better understanding of the process and maybe even a way to help remember the steps.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the video version, check below:</p>

<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Machine Learning Process</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">First, let's briefly go over the machine learning process. Here's a diagram that's known as the cross-industry standard process for data mining, or simply known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-industry_standard_process_for_data_mining" target="_blank">CRISP-DM</a>.</p>
</div>

























  
       [caption id="" align="alignnone" width="721"]<img src="https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/521545a6e4b0734032a27076/1620565377528-SWZ6ZD07Y4D5U4P5CIU2/CRISPDM.png?format=original" alt=" Kenneth Jensen - Own work based on: ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/modeler/18.0/en/ModelerCRISPDM.pdf  (Figure 1) "/>  Kenneth Jensen - Own work based on: ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/analytics/spss/documentation/modeler/18.0/en/ModelerCRISPDM.pdf  (Figure 1) [/caption] 
  



<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">The machine learning process is pretty straight forward when going through the diagram:</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Business understanding - What exactly is the problem we are trying to solve with data</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Data understanding - What exactly is in our data, such as what does each column mean and how does it relate to the business problem</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Data prep - Data preprocessing and preparation. This can also include feature engineering</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Modeling - Getting a model from our data</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Evaluation - Evaluating the model for performance on generalized data</p></li><li><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Deployment - Deploying the model for production use</p></li></ul><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Note that a couple of items can go back and forth. You may do multiple iterations of getting a better understanding of the business problem and the data, data prep and modeling, and even going back to the business problem when evaluating a model.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Notice that there's a circle around the whole process which means you may even have to go back to understanding the problem once a model is deployed.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">There are a couple of items I would add to help improve this process, though. First, we need to think about getting our data. Also, I believe can add a separate item in the process for improving our model.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Getting Data</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I would actually add an item before or after defining the business problem, and that's getting data. Sometimes you may have the data already and define the business problem but you may have to get the data after defining the problem. Either way, we need good data. You may have heard an old saying in programming, "Garbage in, garbage out", and that applies to machine learning as well.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can't have a good model unless we give it good data.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Improving the Model</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Once we have an algorithm we can also spend some time to improve it even further. We can deploy some techniques that can tweak the algorithm to perform better.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now that we understand the machine learning process a bit better, let's see how it relates to cooking.</p><h1 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Relating the Machine Learning Process to Cooking</h1><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">At first glance, you may not see how the machine learning process relates to cooking at all. But let's go into more detail of the machine learning process and how each step relates to cooking.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Business Understanding</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">One of the first things to do for the machine learning process is to get a business understanding of the problem.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For cooking, we know we want to make a dish, but which one? What do we want to accomplish with our dish? Is it for breakfast, lunch, or dinner? Is it for just us or do we want to create something for a family of four?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Knowing these will help us determine what we want to cook.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Getting Data</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I would actually add an item before or after defining the business problem, and that's getting data. Sometimes you may have the data already and define the business problem but you may have to get the data after defining the problem. Either way, we need good data. You may have heard an old saying in programming, "Garbage in, garbage out", and that applies to machine learning as well.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">We can't have a good model unless we give it good data.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Data Processing</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Data processing is perhaps the most important step after getting good data. Depending on how you process the data will depend on how well your model performs.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For cooking, this is equivalent to preparing your ingredients. This includes chopping any ingredients such as vegetables, but keeping a consistent size when chopping also counts. This helps the pieces cook evenly. If some pieces are smaller they can burn or if some pieces are bigger then they may not be fully cooked.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Also, just like in machine learning there are multiple ways to process your data, there are also different ways to prepare ingredients. In fact, there's a word for processing all of your ingredients before you start cooking - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mise_en_place" target="_blank">mise en place</a> - which is French for "everything in it's place". This is done in cooking shows all the time where they have everything ready to start cooking.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">This actually also makes sense for machine learning. We have to have all of our data processing done on the training data before we can give it to the machine learning algorithm.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Modeling</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now it's time for the actual modeling part of the process where we give our data to an algorithm.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">In cooking, this is actually where we cook our dish. In fact, we can relate choosing a recipe to choosing a machine learning algorithm. The recipe will take the ingredients and turn out a dish, and the algorithm will take the data and turn out a model.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Different recipes will turn out different dishes, though. Take a salad, for instance. Depending on the recipe and the ingredients, the salad can turn out to be bright and citrusy like this <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/ree-drummond/kale-citrus-salad-2593844" target="_blank">kale citrus salad</a>. Or, it can be warm and savory like this <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/spinach-salad-with-warm-bacon-dressing-recipe-1947599" target="_blank">spinach salad with bacon dressing</a>.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">They're both salads, but they are turned into different kinds of salads because of different ingredients and recipes. In machine learning, you can have similar models from different data and algorithms.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">What if you have the same ingredients? There are definitely different ways to make the same recipe. Hummus is traditionally made with chickpeas, tahini, garlic, and lemon like in <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/katie-lee/classic-hummus-2333947" target="_blank">this recipe</a>. But there is also <a href="https://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/alton-brown/hummus-for-real-recipe-2014722" target="_blank">this hummus recipe</a> that has the same ingredients but the recipe is just a bit different.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Optimizing the Model</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Depending on the algorithm the machine learning model is using we can give it different parameters that can optimize the model for better performance. These parameter are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_(machine_learning)" target="_blank">hyperparameters</a>, which is used during the learning process of the model to your data.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">These can be updated manually by you choosing values for the hyperparameters. This can be quite tedious and you never know what value to choose. So, instead, there are ways this can be automated by giving a range of values and running the model multiple times with different values and you can use the best performing model that is found.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How do we optimize a dish, though? Perhaps the best way to get the best taste out of your dish, other than using the best ingredients, is to season it. Specifically, seasoning with salt. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ITI3J5UWiyQ" target="_blank">this video</a> by <a href="https://www.ethanchlebowski.com/" target="_blank">Ethan Chlebowski</a>, he suggests</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">…home cooks severely under salt the food they are cooking and is often why the food doesn't taste good.</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">He even quotes this line from the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2Rslw54" target="_blank">Ruhlman's Twenty</a>:</p><blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How to salt food is the most important skill to know in the kitchen.</p></blockquote><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">I've even experienced this in my own cooking where I don't add enough salt. Once I do, the dish tastes 100 times better.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Now, adding salt to your dish is the more manual way of optimizing it with seasoning. Is there a way that this can be automated? Actually, there is! Instead of using just salt and adding other spices to it yourself you can get these seasoning blends that has all the spices in it for you!</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Evaluating the Model</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Evaluating the model is going to be one of the most important steps because this tells you how well your model will perform on new data, or rather, data that it hasn't seen before. During training your model have good performance, but giving it new data may reveal that it actually is performing bad.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Evaluating your cooked dish is a lot more fun, though. This is where you get to eat it! You will determine if it's a good dish by how it tastes. Is it good or bad? If you served it to others, what did they think about it?</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Iterating on the Model</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Iterating on the model is a part of the process that may not seem necessary, but it can be an important one. Your data may change over time which would then make your model stale. That is, it's relying on data that it used to but due to some process change or something similar it no longer does. And since the underlying data changed the model won't predict as well as it did.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Similarly, you may have more or even better data that you can use for training, so you can then retrain the model with that to make better predictions.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">How can you iterate on a dish that you just prepared? First thing is if it was good or bad. If it was bad, then we can revisit the recipe and see if we did anything wrong. Did we overcook it? Did we miss an ingredient? Did we prepare an ingredient incorrectly?</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">If it was good, then we can iterate on it</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">A lot of chefs and home cooks like to take notes about recipes they've made. They write in some tricks they've learned along the way but also some different paths from the recipe that they either had to take due to a missing ingredient or preferred to take.</p><h2 style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Conclusion</h2><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">Hopefully, this helps your better understand the machine learning process through the eyes of cooking a dish. It may even help you understand the importance of each step because, in cooking, if one step is missed then you probably won't be having a good dinner tonight.</p><p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">And if you're wondering where does AutoML fit into all of this, then you can think of it as the meal delivery kits like Hello Fresh or Blue Apron. They do a lot of the work for you and you just have to put it all together.</p>

      <title>What's New in ML.NET Version 1.6</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/7/16/whats-new-in-mlnet-version-16</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Another new release of <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> is now out! The <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/docs/release-notes/1.6.0/release-1.6.0.md">release notes</a> for version 1.6 has all the details, but this post will highlight all of the more interesting updates from this version. I'll also include the pull request for each item in case you want to see more details on it or learn how something was implemented.</p><p>There were a lot of things added to this release, but they did make a note that there are no breaking changes from everything that was added.</p>


<div class="sqs-html-content" data-sqsp-text-block-content>
  <p class="" style="white-space:pre-wrap;">For the video version of this post, check below.</p>

   <iframe class="embedly-embed" src="//cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fembed%2FUJqEYGcwNhU%3Ffeature%3Doembed&display_name=YouTube&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DUJqEYGcwNhU&image=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FUJqEYGcwNhU%2Fhqdefault.jpg&key=61d05c9d54e8455ea7a9677c366be814&type=text%2Fhtml&schema=youtube" width="854" height="480" scrolling="no" title="YouTube embed" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe>
 

<h2 id="support-for-arm">Support for ARM</h2><p>Perhaps the most exciting part of this update is the new <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5789">support for ARM architectures</a>. This will allow for most training and inference in <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a>.</p><p>Why is this update useful? Well, ARM architectures are almost everywhere. As mentioned in the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/ml-net-june-updates-model-builder/#ml-net-on-arm">June update blog post</a> this ARM architectures are included on mobile and embedded devices. This can open up a whole world of opportunities for ML.NET for mobile phones and IoT devices.</p><h2 id="dataframe-updates">DataFrame Updates</h2><p>The <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Data.Analysis/">DataFrame API</a> is probably one of the more exciting packages that's currently in the early stages. Why? Well, .NET doesn't have much in terms of competing with pandas in Python for data analysis or data wrangling to handle some preprocessing that you may need before you send the data into <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> to make a model.</p><p>Why am I including DataFrame updates in a <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> update? Well, the DataFrame API has been <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5641">m</a><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5641">oved into the ML.NET repository</a>! The code used to be in the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/corefxlab">CoreFx Lab repository</a> as an experimental package, but now it's no longer experimental and now part of <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a>. This is great news since it is planned to have many more updates to this API.</p><p>Other DataFrame updates include:</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5821">GroupBy operation extended</a> - While the DataFrame API already had a GroupBy operation, this update adds new property groupings and makes it act more like LINQ's GroupBy operation.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5711">Improved CSV parsing</a> - Implemented the <code>TextFieldParser</code> that can be used when loading a CSV file. This allows the handling of quotes in columns.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5712">Convert</a><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5712"><code>IDataView</code></a><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5712">to</a><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5712"><code>DataFrame</code></a> - We've already had a way to convert a <code>DataFrame</code> object into an <code>IDataView</code> to be able to use data loaded with the DataFrame API into <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a>, but now we can do the opposite where we can load data in <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> and convert it into a DataFrame object to perform further analysis on it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5834">Improved DateTime parsing</a> - This allows for better parsing of date time data.</li>
<li>Improvements to the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5776">Sort</a> and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5778">Merge</a> methods - These updates allow for better handling of null fields when performing a sort or merge.</li>
</ul><p>By the way, if you're looking for a way to help contribute to the <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> repository, helping with the DataFrame API is a great way to get involved. They have quite a few issues already that you can take a look at and help out with. It would be awesome if we got this package on par with pandas to help make C# a great ecosystem to perform data analysis.</p><p>You can use the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3AMicrosoft.Data.Analysis">Microsoft.Data.Analysis label</a> on the issues to filter them out so you can see what all they need help with.</p><h2 id="code-enhancements">Code Enhancements</h2><p>Quite a few of the enhancement updates were code quality updates. In fact, <a href="https://github.com/feiyun0112">feiyun0112</a> did several pull requests that improved the code quality of the repo helping to make it easier for folks to read and maintain it.</p><h2 id="miscellaneous-updates">Miscellaneous Updates</h2><p>There were also quite a lot of updates that didn't really tie in to a single theme. Here are some of the more interesting ones.</p><ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5797">Saving Tensorflow models in the SavedModel format</a> - Allows you to save Tensorflow models to use the <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/saved_model">SavedModel format</a> instead of freezing the graph to save it.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5782">Ability to specify a temp path</a> - You can now specify the temp path location instead of it always going to the default location. This is specified in the <code>MLContext</code>.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5851">Update LightGBM to version 2.3.1</a> - Using this new version can give better results when using the LightGBM algorithms.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5624">Label column name suggestions in AutoML</a> - If you may have mistyped the label column name when using the AutoML API, this update will give suggestions for fixing it.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/docs/release-notes/1.6.0/release-1.6.0.md#build--test-updates">several CI issues</a> - Some tests would sometimes fail in the CI builds so these updates fixed their stability so that you can have more confidence in your pull request.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5811">Updated doc for cross compiling on ARM</a> - Adds a docker image that can be used.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/pull/5815">Updated contribution doc with help wanted tags</a> - Helps direct anyone looking to contribute on where they can find issues.</li>
</ul><p>These are just a few of the changes in this release. Version 1.6 has a lot of stuff in it so I encourage you to go through the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/blob/main/docs/release-notes/1.6.0/release-1.6.0.md">full release notes</a> to see all the items that I didn't include in this post.</p>
<hr /><p>What was your favorite update in this release? Was it ARM support or the new DataFrame enhancements? Let me know in the comments!</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Creating an Object Detection Model with Model Builder and Azure ML</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/8/22/creating-an-object-detection-model-with-model-builder-and-azure-ml</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Object detection models can be quite useful for providing more information about an image than image classification can do. Not only can it give you multiple items in the image but it can also tell you where in the image that those objects are.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3b/Computer_vision_sample_in_Sim%C3%B3n_Bolivar_Avenue%2C_Quito.jpg" alt="Computer vision sample in Simón Bolivar Avenue, Quito - Object detection - Wikipedia">
By Comunidad de Software Libre Hackem [Research Group] - <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmMFsL1ahI4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZmMFsL1ahI4</a>, CC BY-SA 3.0, <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=92687514">https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=92687514</a></p>
<p>Object detection is very helpful in several industries. In health care we can have an x-ray photo and the model can detect if there is cancer in the image, but also where in the image that it is. With that information the doctors can act on it and give the patient the treatment that they need.</p>
<p>There's also a lot of applications in manufacturing. A part or a complete component that was made can have a photo of it taken and an object detection model can determine if there are any defects. If there are, and since it tells you where the defect is, it can be fixed a lot quicker.</p>
<h2 id="data">Data</h2>
<p>The data we will use is from a <a href="">Microsoft tutorial</a> that goes into object detection and uses the <a href="">stop sign</a> data set. We will use this data to create a model to determine if an image incluces a stop sign and where in the image the stop sign is located.</p>
<h2 id="generating-data-with-vott">Generating Data with VoTT</h2>
<p>However, the trickiest thing about creating an object detection model is getting the data. The data needs to have the bounding boxes, or the coordinates, of where the objects are in the image. Those bounding boxes aren't very trivia to get on your own. Luckily, we have an application from Microsoft that can help - Visual Object Tagging Tool or <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/VoTT">VoTT</a>.</p>
<p>There's a great <a href="">doc</a> on the official Microsoft docs site, but we'll also go over how to use VoTT in this post. </p>
<p>While there is an online version of VoTT, I will use the downloadable version to generate the data even while offline.</p>
<h3 id="create-new-vott-project">Create new VoTT project</h3>
<p>Once you download the latest version of VoTT and open it you will be greeted by a screen to create a new project or to open one either locally or on the cloud. We will create a new project.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210826130923.png]]</p>
<p>Once we click to create a new project we have the following options that we need to fill in:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Display name</strong>: The name of the project.</li>
<li><strong>Source Connection</strong>: This is where the images are located. Since we have them on our hard drive, I have this set as <code>LocalConnection</code>. </li>
<li><strong>Target Connection</strong>: This is where VoTT will output files.</li>
</ul>
<p>For the other options we can leave the defaults. Let's fill in the three items that we need.</p>
<p>The Display Name is set as <code>StopSignObjectDetection</code>. For the Source Connection, we will slick <strong>Add Connection</strong>.</p>
<p>We have another screen to add the connection with a couple of items to fill out. First, we need to give it a name. We can set this as <strong>StopSignInput</strong>. For the "Provider" section, this is what we will tell VoTT where the images are located. There are a couple of options here but we will select <strong>Local File System</strong>. This displays a new field where we give it the folder path where our images are. If you downloaded the stop sign dataset the images will be in the "stop signs\stop-sign-dataset\Stop-Signs" folder from where you extracted it at. Now we can click <strong>Save Connection</strong>.</p>
<p>With the new connection saved we can now set the <strong>Source Connection</strong> field to the connection we just created.</p>
<p>The <strong>Target Connection</strong> will be similar where we click the <strong> Add Connection</strong> button and give it the same fields. We can set the display name as <code>StopSignOutput</code> and set the "Provider" to the local system, again. To help keep the files separated, I tend to create an "output" folder so the output won't be in the same folder as the input.</p>
<p>With those filled out, the Project Settings will look something like this:
![[Pasted image 20210829080114.png]]</p>
<p>Now we can click on the <strong>Save Project</strong> button to start tagging our images.</p>
<h3 id="tagging-images-in-vott">Tagging Images in VoTT</h3>
<p>At this point VoTT should display the images on the left side and the currently selected one in the middle. On the right there is the tagging area. It should look similar to this:</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210829080711.png]]</p>
<h4 id="creating-a-tag">Creating a Tag</h4>
<p>Before we can start tagging we should create at least one tag. To created one, click on the plus icon in the tagging area toolbar.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210829080915.png]]</p>
<p>We can now type in the name of our tag, which we will call <code>stop-sign</code>, and click Enter to accept it.</p>
<p>We will only have this one tag, but you can create as many tags as you need. You can also create tags later on if you feel that you need more than what you initially created.</p>
<h4 id="tagging-images">Tagging Images</h4>
<p>With our tag created we can now do the manual task of tagging all of your images. Even though this task is manual it's still a lot easier to do this than trying to figure out the bounding boxes yourself.</p>
<p>You should see a screen like this:
![[Pasted image 20210829172214.png]]</p>
<p>You can scroll through all of the images on the left. The middle is where you'll do the tagging. You can use your mouse to drag the region that you want to become the bounding box. Once you do that to all of the items in the image you want to tag you can click on the tag on the tag page on the right</p>
<p>However, a nice shortcut is to bypass clicking on the tag that you want. If you look closer at the tag there is a number on the right of it.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210829172716.png]]</p>
<p>This is the keyboard shortcut that you can use to quickly tag your objects. So you can use the numbers corresponding to the tag to tag it instantly once you got the bounding box.</p>
<p>Here's a gif to show this in action for a couple of objects.</p>
<p>![[Untitled Project.gif]]</p>
<p>Now you may noticed the images on the left has an icon that changes when going to an image and when tagging.</p>
<p>The orange icon indicates that the image has been visited but hasn't been tagged yet.
![[Pasted image 20210829173508.png]]</p>
<p>The green icon indicates tha tthe image has been tagged.
![[Pasted image 20210829173639.png]]</p>
<p>This is actually nice because you can quickly see which images haven't been tagged or even seen in VoTT yet.</p>
<p>Now that we have all of our images tagged we can export the data into a JSON format. This format will be used within Model Builder to send to Azure ML to build our object detection model.</p>
<p>On the top toolbar the last item will be the export button.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210829174725.png]]</p>
<p>Once you click this it will export all of the data to the Target Location that we defined earlier when setting up our project.</p>
<p>If you go into the Target Location you will see a lot of JSON files. Each JSON file will correspond to each image. However, the JSON file we care about is in the "vott-json-export" folder. This is the file that Model Builder will use. I'll reiterate this again during the data step of Model Builder since this can be easy to miss. I know because I've missed what JSON file to use several times earlier on.</p>
<p>This finishes what we need from VoTT. Now we'll jump to Visual Studio to create a Model Builder project to build our object detection model for us.</p>
<h3 id="creating-the-model-builder-project">Creating the Model Builder Project</h3>
<p>In Visual Studio, we can create a blank Console project. This is so we can have a project to right click and go to Add -&gt; Machine Learning.</p>
<p>From there we can create a new <code>mbconfig</code> file. If you haven't seen the <code>mbconfig</code> file before it's fairly new in Model Builder. It stores all the information for each step so if you need to close the Model Builder window or need to come back to it a few days later to tweak a model, you can double click on it and it keeps the same state that it had before.</p>
<p> We'll name our Model Builder project "StopSignDetection" and continue.</p>
<p> With the project created we now have to tell Model Builder what scenario we want. We'll select the Object Detection scenario. Notice that this scenario can only be trained in Azure ML. Currently, there is no local option.</p>
<p> ![[Pasted image 20210829180728.png]]</p>
<p> Since we can only train in Azure ML, we will have to set up a workspace. This is actually great because we can utilize GPUs if our machine doesn't have one. Of course my machine doesn't so the training will go much quicker than training on the CPU.</p>
<p> Model Builder really helps us out by having the workspace creation all within the GUI. If there's anything we need to create we can do it right there.</p>
<p> ![[Pasted image 20210829181110.png]]</p>
<p> If you need to create a new compute, I believe it will be best if the priority is set to "Dedicated".</p>
<p> ![[Pasted image 20210829181941.png]]</p>
<p>With the enviornment created we can click on the "Next Step" button to move on to the data step.</p>
<p>In this step we will use the JSON file from VoTT. Remember, this will be the JSON file that is in the "vott-json-export" folder. Once that's uploaded you should see a preview of the images and the names of the tags.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210829182252.png]]</p>
<p>From here we can click "Next Step" and this will take us to the training step. From here we just click the "Start Training" button to start the training process. This will prepare our Azure ML workspace, upload all of the images to Azure, and Azure ML will take those images and train the model for us.</p>
<p>Warning: After you're done training it is highly recommended to delete the compute that you created for Model Builder. This is to help you not incur any other costs from having the compute on after the training.</p>
<p>Once training is complete you should see something similar to the following output.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210829184615.png]]</p>
<p>You may notice that the accuracy is 100%. This is a bit of a red flag and may indicate overfitting, but we can do some testing to see how it performs. We'll continue with what we have, though, to show the rest of the process.</p>
<p>In fact we can do a test on a new image now. We can go to <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a> and search for "stop sign" and get a new image that has a stop sign in it.</p>
<p>I found this image that we can do a quick test with from Unsplash:
![[Pasted image 20210829190512.png]]</p>
<p>Let's see how this performs on our model in the "Evaluate" step.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210829190615.png]]</p>
<p>This did really good and predicted the stop sign at a 98% confidence. That's pretty good for an image the model has yet to see.</p>
<h4 id="consume-model-in-console-app">Consume Model in Console App</h4>
<p>The next step is the "Consume" step in Model Builder. This is optional but the templates here offer a very quick and easy way to consume the model. Especially since it shows how you can calculate the bounding boxes for the image. Let's add a console app and see how it looks.</p>
<p>To add the console app, click the <strong>Add to Solution</strong> link for it.</p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20210830035507.png]]</p>
<p>This will show a popup asking what you want to name the product. We can name it "StopSignDetection_Console" and click the button to add it to our current solution.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>The ML.NET Deep Learning Plans</title>
      <link>/blog/2021/9/13/the-mlnet-deep-learning-plans</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>One of the most requested features for ML.NET is the ability to create neural networks models from scratch to perform deep learning in ML.NET. The ML.NET team has taken that feedback and the feedback from the <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/ml-net-june-updates-model-builder/#ml-net-survey-results">customer survey</a> and has come out with a plan to start implementing this feature.</p>
<h2 id="current-state-of-deep-learning-in-ml-net">Current State of Deep Learning in ML.NET</h2>
<p>Currently, in ML.NET, there isn't a way to create neural networks to have deep learning models from scratch. There is great support for taking an existing deep learning model and using it for predictions, however. If you have a TensorFlow or ONNX model then those can be used in ML.NET to make predictions.</p>
<p>There is also great support for transfer learning in ML.NET. This allows you to take your own data and train it against a pretrained model to give you a model of your own.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned earlier, ML.NET does not yet have the capability to let you create your own deep learning models from scratch. Let's take a look at what the plans are for this.</p>
<h2 id="future-deep-learning-plans">Future Deep Learning Plans</h2>
<p>In the ML.NET GitHub repo there is an <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5918">issue</a> that was fairly recently created that goes over the plans to implement creating deep learning models in ML.NET. </p>
<p>There are two reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Communicate to the community about what the plans are and that this is being worked on.</li>
<li>Get feedback from the community on the current plan.</li>
</ol>
<p>While we'll touch on the main points in the issue in this post, I would highly encourage you to go through it and give any feedback or questions about the plans you may have to help the ML.NET team in their planning or implementation.</p>
<p>The issue details three parts in order to deliver creating deep learning models in ML.NET:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make consuming of ONNX models easier</li>
<li>Support TorchSharp and make it production ready</li>
<li>Create an API in ML.NET to support TorchSharp</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's go into each of these in more detail.</p>
<h3 id="easier-use-of-onnx-models">Easier Use of ONNX Models</h3>
<p>While you can currently use ONNX models in ML.NET right now, you do have to know the input and output names in order to use it. Right now we rely on the <a href="https://netron.app/">Netron</a> application to load the ONNX models to give us the input and output names. While this isn't bad, the team wants to expose an internal way to get these instead of having to rely on a separate application.</p>
<p>Of course, along with the new way to get the input and output names for ONNX models, the documentation will definitely be updated to reflect this. I believe, not only documentation, but examples would follow to show how to do this.</p>
<h3 id="supporting-torchsharp">Supporting TorchSharp</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/TorchSharp">TorchSharp</a> is the heart of how ML.NET will implement deep learning. Similar to how <a href="https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET">Tensorfow.NET</a> supports scoring TensorFlow models in ML.NET, this will provide access to the PyTorch library in Python. <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> is starting to lead the way in building deep learning models in research and in industry so it makes sense to implmement in ML.NET.</p>
<p>In fact, one of the popular libraries to build deep learning models is <a href="https://course.fast.ai/">FastAI</a>. Not only is FastAI one of the best courses to take when learning deep learning, but the Python library is one of the best in terms of building deep learning models. Under the hood, though, FastAI uses PyTorch to actually build the models that it produces. This isn't by accident. The FastAI developers decided that PyTorch was the way to go for this.</p>
<p>TensorFlow is great to support for predicting existing models, but for building new ones from scratch I really think PyTorch and TorchSharp is the preferred way. To do this, TorchSharp will help ML.NET lead the way. </p>
<h3 id="implementing-torchsharp-into-ml-net">Implementing TorchSharp into ML.NET</h3>
<p>The final stage is, once TorchShap has been made production ready, create a high-level API in ML.NET to train deep learning models from scratch.</p>
<p>This will be like when Keras came along for TensorFlow. It was an API on top of TensorFlow to help make building the models much easier. I believe ML.NET can do that for TorchSharp.</p>
<p>This will probably be a big undertaking but definitely worth doing. This will be the API people will use to build their models so taking the time to get this the best way possible. will be worth it in the long run to let us build our models the most trivial way possible which will make us more productive in the long run.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Creating deep learning models from scratch is, by far, one of the most requested features for ML.NET and their plan to do this is definitely going to reach this goal. In fact, I think it will surpass this goal since it will use PyTorch on the backend which is where research and the industry is leaning towards.</p>
<p>If you have any feedback or questions, definitely feel free to comment on the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5918">GitHub issue</a>.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What's New in the ML.NET CLI</title>
      <link>/blog/2023/1/22/whats-new-in-the-mlnet-cli</link>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> CLI has gotten some interesting updates. This post will go over the main items that are new.</p>
<p>For a video version of this post, check below.</p>




 
   <iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZApDu_Q_0-8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen title="What&#39;s New in the ML.NET CLI"></iframe>
 

<h1 id="new-install-name">New Install Name</h1><p>The first thing to make note of is that there is a new name when installing the newer versions of the <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> CLI. Since the file size got too big for a single .NET tool, it is now split up into multiple installs depending on what operating system and CPU architecture you're running.</p><p><img src="https://t1253902.p.clickup-attachments.com/t1253902/754024c3-082a-4088-bd67-22e82c56b0dc/image.png" alt=""></p><p>So getting the newest version will require a new install even if you have the older version installed. Actually, I would recommend to go ahead and uninstall the older version of the CLI if you already have it installed. This can be done with the <code>dotnet tool uninstall mlnet --global</code> command.</p><p>So depending on your machine is what you will install. I have a M1 MacBook Pro, so I would install the <code>mlnet-osx-arm</code> version. If you're on Windows, you will probably be installing the <code>mlnet-win-x64</code> version.</p><p>If you want to update a previously installed newer version, you can use the <code>dotnet tool update</code> command.</p><h1 id="train-with-a-mbconfig-file">Train with a <code>mbconfig</code> File</h1><p>With the new CLI release, it comes with a couple of new command. The first we'll go over is the <code>train</code> command. This takes in a single required argument, which is a <code>mbconfig</code> file. This will use the information in the <code>mbconfig</code> file and will perform another training run.</p><p>This can be good for a few scenarios, including continuous integration where the <code>mbconfig</code> file is checked into version control and can be run each day to see if a new model can be discovered.</p><h1 id="forecasting">Forecasting</h1><p>Along with the <code>train</code> command a new scenario has been added - forecasting. Forecasting is primarily used for time series data to forecast values in the future. Similar to the other scenarios, we have a few arguments we can pass in.</p><p><img src="https://t1253902.p.clickup-attachments.com/t1253902/cab9c525-5135-423c-9186-ea6ec313c31d/image.png" alt=""></p><p>The <code>dataset</code> and <code>label-col</code> arguments are similar to the other scenarios, but forecasting has a couple of others that are required - <code>horizon</code> and <code>time-col</code> .</p><p>The <code>horizon</code> argument is simply the number of items in the future you want the forecasting algorithm to predict.</p><p>The <code>time-col</code> argument is just the column that has the time or dates that the algorithm can use.</p><p>And we can run this like other scenarios with the below command. We'll let it run only for 10 seconds with the <code>--train-time</code> argument. The data can be found <a href="https://github.com/rishabh89007/Time_Series_Datasets/blob/main/Wind%20Gen.csv">here</a> if you want to run it as well.</p><pre><code class="lang-plain">mlnet forecasting --dataset C:/dev/wind_gen.txt --horizon 3 --label-col 1 --time-col 0 --train-time 10</code></pre><p><img src="https://t1253902.p.clickup-attachments.com/t1253902/34d1edb2-7548-4e7f-84cf-a4e6de01c022/image.png" alt=""></p><hr><p>A couple of big additions to the CLI and I'm sure more are coming. It is nice to see that the <a href="http://ML.NET">ML.NET</a> team is continuing to keep the CLI's features on par with Model Builder.</p>]]></content:encoded>
