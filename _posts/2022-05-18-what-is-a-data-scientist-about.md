# What is a data scientist about?

A data scientist is, I believe, ultimately someone that's part of a data science team that can generate value to a company or product. To do this they use their tools of programming and statistics to try to answer questions related to the business.

For example, I can be a data scientist in a business that is a streaming service for programming tutorials. Some questions me and my team may want to know to improve the business may be:

- What promotions gain the most new subscribers?

- Which type of videos generate new subscribers?

- What videos do users watch the most?

Answering these questions and others can help the business go in a direction that serves the customer the best.

## Duties and knowledge areas

Data scientists have, I would say, a wide range of duties and areas they would need to know to help them in their daily tasks.
